Having crossed the threshold of Rs. 3,00,000 crore, India\u2019s new defense budget falls way short for modernization plans. Considering the previous statement, it portrays the misplaced priority of the Indian Government in the Union budget allocation of 2019. In the lieu of the attacks over the Indian part of Kashmir, which affected the national integrity and security, higher allocation of budget to defense shall not be the answer to the improved security of our country. Taking into fact, the recent scams in defense equipment acquisitions and the budget portion allocated thereafter, it surely calls for attention over this allotment of money in the defense section. The rough demand put up by the MoD after reckoning all the expenditures, salaries, pensions, etc and budget allocated thereafter has a two-fold difference. While the Make in India initiative is already supporting the defense sector then does this big numbers in terms of money required? The crystal clear answer is a NO! The Indian defense system is on the run of upgradation with well-sought funds from the center as well the public sector undertaking i.e.: National Defence Sector Units(NDSU), thus raising the threshold for MoD budget while compromising the holistic National development proves futile.<\/p><p>While there are issues pertaining to health, unemployment, sanitation, infrastructure, transport, imports &amp; exports, etc., 2019\u2019s budget shows the misplaced priority of Indian Government in the distribution of gross national income via the budget. While the people of our country are facing major health issues due to poor sanitation and hygiene, this type of majorized budget allotment to the ministry of defense stands questionable. As per the analysis, the Defence budget is around 5 times the Health budget 2019. This shows the non-prioritisation and negligence of health of the people in the country, by the government. The health sector demands more investment for research, the National Health Scheme(NHS) and treatment of various diseases at the govt. run hospitals and health centers.<\/p><p>On a similar line, the coastal road infrastructure development requires fast track but due to unavailability of funds, the development is facing hindrance which is costing a huge loss to our economy. Thus, the prioritizing of these projects is being neglected on certain lines by the government and the current budget allocation justifies this misplaced priority. There are various issues mainly overcoming poverty and improving public infrastructure which the government needs to prioritize in the budget allocation. I wish to conclude by stating clearly that the defense budget of 2019 shows the misplaced priority of the Indian government.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c4835fa elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"c4835fa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/VRAJAL-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Vrajal Choksi\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Vrajal Choksi<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-98ab5fd elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"98ab5fd\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">AGAINST<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-fb0963a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"fb0963a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\"><p>\u201cAn estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time&#8221;, this is what you get when you google the word Budget. This definition of the word Budget has a lot to say about why the proposed budget has been highest for Military purposes this year. I think this move of our government is right. Why? I guess this was the right time.<\/p><p>First, let me brief you on where the money is being spent in the Military budget. Primarily, it\u2019s for the purchase of the new weapons, aircrafts, warships and other military hardware. Also, some of the money is used for the payment of the pensions. Other than this, the budget comprises the expenses on payment of salaries and maintenance of different establishments. According to a report, the defense budget is around 1.44% of the GDP.<\/p><p>This year, the Military budget was high because the government felt that there was a need for the upgrade in the amenities and other facilities for the military. There is nothing wrong about spending money on the brave souls who relentlessly work to protect us and our families. India has always tried to maintain peace with the neighbouring countries, be it China, Pakistan or any other country. Spending more on the Military budget does not mean India will decrease its measures to maintain peace in the future. You may not be convinced with all this, so let me explain you with a different approach.<\/p><p>Poverty and unemployment. These are some of the key points in the answer to the question of &#8220;Why India is a developing country?&#8221;. These are time consuming and complex problems which demand a long term solution. Poverty arises due to less income and less income arises due to unemployment. Generating more employment opportunities in the country is one solution to both of the problems. The government have started various schemes(e.g., Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment) and publishing magazines(e.g., Employment News) which basically focus on increasing the employment rate in the country. Also, government has always been helping the poor class of the people for satisfying their basic needs.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would say that spending more on the Military budget was right, because it had to be done. The nation&#8217;s security is more important than other problems of our country. In the present situation of our country, we all can at least agree that if this move was not taken right now, it would have in turn affected the citizens of our country later. The other problems of our country are also crucial and are needed to be looked upon, but the improvements on the Military and Defense areas cannot be compromised or postponed due to those problems.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-eeb9803 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"eeb9803\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/IMG_20190413_211655.jpg\" alt=\"Rushit Shukla\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Rushit Shukla<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IC, 2nd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FOR The allocation of $60.9 billion in the Union budget, 2019 on 1st February, to the Ministry of Defence has raised speculation pertaining to the highest ever allocation of the defense budget in the history of India.
