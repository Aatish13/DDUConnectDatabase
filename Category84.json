I gulped down the sputum down my throat, tried to get up and figure out where I was. People were looking at me. Those eyes were aberrant to me, yet customary for them.<\/p><p>&#8220;Here. Take my hand.&#8221; a slightly older man offered his hand to me. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember anything.&#8221; was the first thing I said and he smiled. At first he seemed sly to me, but as it turned out, he was quite a generous old man. He also explained to me the meaning of this place and the meaning of us all being here. Apparently, this was a place where people were sent after they die. However, it wasn&#8217;t heaven or hell, it was a place for souls with questions. People knew they&#8217;re dead but don&#8217;t remember what caused it. But, do I have any questions?<\/p><p>Jos\u00e9, as he said his name was, guided me through the place and also briefed me about all the people who greeted me. They were nice to me except for one woman. I sure didn&#8217;t know who she was and I thought she doesn&#8217;t either, but she looked at me with ire and left. I asked Jos\u00e9 what was wrong with her, to which he answered &#8220;She&#8217;s the odd one&#8221; referring to her mental condition. Maybe I&#8217;ll talk to her someday. I told myself.<\/p><p>Five days had passed and I still didn&#8217;t remember my name. Why? I muttered to myself while walking towards a group of people. The place wasn&#8217;t so bad. It was huge and every evening we had this gathering where everyone shared whatever they wanted to. &#8220;Girl!&#8221; exclaimed one of the old men. &#8220;Did you recall your name yet?&#8221; he asked with amusement. Flustered, I tucked a lock of hair behind my ear and shook my head. &#8220;Mm-Maya&#8221; said someone from the crowd. People made a way to disclose the person who spoke. It was Amy, the odd one. &#8220;What?&#8221; I asked curiously. &#8220;Mm-Maya heh-h&#8221; she repeated. Everyone looked at her intrigued. But Amy ravingly, just left the place. Everyone thought this was just an Amy-incident but I didn&#8217;t feel so. She had been acting weird with me since the day she saw me I don&#8217;t know why. I followed her and called out her name. She wouldn&#8217;t stop until I grabbed ahold of her.<\/p><p>&#8220;Amy do you know my name?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Maya&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;What do you know about me?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t answer and continued laughing. &#8220;Tell me!&#8221; I asked demandingly. &#8220;You killed me!&#8221; she shouted with amusement and started to leave the spot.<\/p><p>&#8220;What are you talking about? How do you know that?&#8221; I demanded for an answer. &#8220;You came to my place and suffocated me with a carry bag hehe&#8221; she answered. She acted as if all this was a joke. &#8220;You&#8217;re mad and I&#8217;m going.&#8221; I started walking towards the opposite direction. &#8220;You had been taking pills before killing me to forget what happened. L-look at your sk-skin, isn&#8217;t it pale?&#8221; she told me. I paused and orderly looked at my hands. They were pale. But maybe she was just bluffing. Why would I take beta blockers before actually killing her? Wouldn&#8217;t it be logical that I took them after I committed the crime? And for all the sake, how did she even know me? Yes, she&#8217;s just bluffing. I fastened away from her.<\/p><p>&#8220;D-don&#8217;t you want to know who killed your baby?&#8221;<\/p><p>Startled, I looked at her. She paused for a brief moment and shouted &#8220;I did!&#8221; A tear left my eye. I had a baby? Suddenly everything inside me felt callous. &#8220;What did you do? Tell me what you did. Please!&#8221; I cried. I wanted to annihilate the woman&#8217;s existence. She just looked at me with a bulwark on, while tears rolled down me cheeks until I became physically unable to maintain my posture.<\/p><p>&#8220;I ran my c-car over your boy because I didn&#8217;t l-like him being with you.&#8221; she said blatantly. &#8220;You knew I did it but people won&#8217;t listen. You turned into a fleabag and started taking pills to forget. Monday night you came to m-my place and started a c- about your boy&#8217;s death. Then you killed me.&#8221; She blankly stated all of this as if nothing mattered.<\/p><p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I remember my past then? Like all the other people here?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you get it? You continued taking pills. It makes you forget things! You probably had no memory when you died.&#8221; I tried to put the pieces together. Everything made sense now. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t deserve to live. Like my boy Sage. No boy deserves to live. Like my boy Sage.&#8221; She chanted these line again and again. I felt, empty.<\/p><p>&#8220;He is here you know? Your boy.&#8221; I gazed at her with my now crimson eyes waiting for her to say more. &#8220;And I really really like it that he doesn&#8217;t remember you yet. That I recognize him everyday and you can&#8217;t. It really pleases me.&#8221; &#8220;Please tell me where he is.&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What is it worth? Lincoln won&#8217;t even recognize you!&#8221; she stated.<\/p><p>&#8220;Lincoln..&#8221; I huffed. A sudden gush of elation ran through me. &#8220;Lincoln! Lincoln!&#8221; I shouted. I looked at every boy&#8217;s face, tried to recall anything at all. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t stop. He was here. I felt like what the tides would feel when the full moon accompanied. I have to find him. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221;<\/p><p>&#8220;M-mom?&#8221; A sweet voice followed my calling.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don\u2019t consider myself a frequent reader and books relating to mythology have never been of huge interest to me. Hence, it was not surprising to any of my friends when I responded with cynicism when they recommended your Shiva Trilogy over and over again. One of them finally thrust a copy of Immortals of Meluha at me and forced me to read it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stuck on a rail journey of almost 36 hours, I had nothing to do. So I started reading the Immortals of Meluha. You have written the story in a well-paced manner and that kept me engrossed. The way you have described Shiva, the marijuana smoking Tibetian immigrant, who cannot adapt to the stoic ways of the Meluhans yet who is open with his hugs without inhibition is simply magical. You make your readers learn to like him, want him to win, to celebrate with him and cry with him. Your fan-boyish love and admiration towards Shiva is clearly observed in every line of the tale. Now I like Shiva as a man of flesh and blood rather than a diety.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I read the book what amazed me was that you have given equal priority to all the portrayal of the female characters. There are female warriors, the prime minister of the nation is itself a strong woman and of course the heroine of the tale, Sati has been shown as a woman who has enough backbone to fight an army of enemies. Even Shiva\u2019s attraction towards Sati is on the grounds of her courage rather than the beauty or other stereotypically feminine attributes. Your way of thinking about equality of sexes for social growth and progress is admirable. A society built purely based on merit and not on caste, race or gender; this utopian ideal is examined with brutal honesty in your every book.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew that Sati would die from the starting even then when I read the way you described it, it nearly brought me in tears. Many avid fans of yours who followed the three books from the beginning were quite disappointed by the understated climax. However, I loved it because I guess you avoided the usually opted clich\u00e9 route. As a Shiva fan, which you make every normal person who reads the book; one expects the clich\u00e9 turnabout that Shiva will choose the righteous path that he as Neelkanth is espoused to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Not you, though.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You have portrayed Shiva as human as possible from the starting of the book. One with human failings and emotional upheavals. Shiva is not a god and you proved it that even great men can lose kindness and compassion in the face of enormous loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After completing the Trilogy, I read the Scion of Ishvaku. It was awesome to go through the world that you created. Now I\u2019m eagerly waiting for your next publication.

family. Especially in India, the closeness and attachments we have for our family are very strong. It becomes twice as much when we grow up in a joint family. You must be wondering what it&#8217;s like to be in a joint family. Well ahoy! Come on down to the clown town!<\/p><p>My family for once, is like a circus. Every circus is defined by its ringmaster. Well in our case, the ringmaster is my grandfather. Talking to him always feels like walking on a thin rope. My grandmother being a juggler, having upper hand over everything and managing it without failure. But at the same time, she&#8217;s a doll from the doll house. My dad is like an acrobat. Never settling, one who always has to run errands and also provide for the family with the performance. My uncle here, can be any of those huge cute animals, like a bear. He&#8217;s always there to entertain, play with or even give free hugs! My mother and aunt being the safety net, always there to take my fall. My siblings are the dwarfs from the circus, as annoying as quacking ducks and extremely frenzy like monkeys. And how can I forget the giant elephant who&#8217;s most loved and is known for eating for eternity and eternity? It&#8217;s me ladies and gentlemen. I&#8217;m Apu for you.<\/p><p>Every circus is known for a performance which thrills the performers as well as the viewers. The most exciting thing about my family is dinner. It normally starts with us sitting at the table waiting for food, me arguing with my brother about table space and how he shouldn&#8217;t rest his hand in my territory, in the lowest voice possible because god forbid, if my dada comes to know, one of us is probably gonna end up eating in the backyard. My father &#8220;loosens&#8221; his belt to make space in the tummy, enough to let ten African kids starve. The dining table is silent for a while but actually it&#8217;s the silence before the thunder, until a family member presents opinions about the news of the previous day. Now I&#8217;m quite sure after this the neighbours probably think we&#8217;re having a contention, a huge family drama. But it&#8217;s quite literally on what to cook for lunch the next day. Then we talk about how we spent the day and at last me trying to forcibly gulp the eggplant down. Sigh!<\/p><p>If you live in a joint family, you&#8217;re always familiar with the cries of stubborn cousins and hollers of aged uncles, gossips of the girl gang and cricket matches of the dad club. There will be family members of different nature and temperament in one house. You are taught the invaluable lesson of sharing from an early age. As tiring and overly annoying it might seem, there are some little joys that you only experience when you grow up in a joint family. Like listening to the amazing stories your grandparents tell you isn&#8217;t a once in a while affair. There&#8217;s no end to the unparalleled moments with your cousins. Every family trip becomes a major larger-than-life event that turns into a celebration. When there&#8217;s a special occasion like a wedding or a festival, the entire home changes into a grand spectacle. And the biggest perk of all, there will never come a day when there&#8217;s absolutely no home cooked food.<\/p><p>If there ever comes a point when you need advice, you&#8217;ll get tons of insightful opinions. The phrase &#8220;all for one and one for all&#8221; is literally true and fitting in a joint family. At the end of the day, family is all you have and in a joint family, you get to cherish that fact every single day.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0283935 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0283935\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-dd8acd7 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"dd8acd7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bd05f48 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bd05f48\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Priya Rathod\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT 3rd SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s nothing greater than a family.

fade&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Empty pockets don\u2019t ever make the grade &#8230;.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is all I remember. My mother used to sing me this lullaby which she says her mother used to sing it to her. It\u2019s been 16 years since my mother died and this incomplete, half-remembered lullaby is the only memory I have of her.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today at work, the hours of my day went passing by without a whimper or a cry and wrapping up for the day while drifting in my thoughts, I reminiscence it- the lullaby. Maybe for an instance, the time had stopped, while I felt engulfed by my mother\u2019s hug and scent and my mind drifted back to the time when she used to buy me cotton candies and then we spent the day aimlessly at the dock counting the ships and dreaming of chasing butterflies one day.<\/p>\n<p>The sun was setting down today bright and shiny, yet subtle. It looked kind and at peace and made me feel at ease, the way my mother used to make me feel and again I memorized the lullaby because that\u2019s the only string which keeps me connected to my mother. My skin felt the sun\u2019s warmth and my heart smiled. The sun waved back at me as I waved it goodbye.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the sun set down, it brought darkness and fear with it. The moon was yet to rise and it was darkness all around. It made me freak out, panicked and I wanted to scream out loud but then I tried to remember the lullaby my mother used to sing to me when I was afraid. The words started flowing in my mind giving me strength and courage to stand against the dark. But this time it was different as I was all alone without my mother. But the lullaby kept on giving me strength and making me strong every moment so that I rise and become powerful enough to withstand the world all by myself.<\/p><p>This lullaby has not only taught me to be strong but, it has also inculcated some traditional values in me which I think makes my mother more than happy. At every step of my life whenever I needed my mother all I need to do was to memorize the lullaby in my mind and then at next moment I find my mother standing next to me holding my hands, supporting me. I don\u2019t know but the lullaby was so hypnotic that it made me want to listen to it daily and maybe it was my mother\u2019s voice which made it more musical.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element

In deep, untamed, uninhibited love that runs deep in my veins and stomach for that matter. I was at the doorstep, making my debut entrance at the La Pino\u2019z. The irresistible smell, the aroma of flavours and the rich colours and everything else in the restaurant had me under control. I said to myself \u201cSruthi; this is gonna be the love of your life. Hold it tight and never let it go.\u201d Well; for me the love of my life is not a human being rather is the different delicacies existing in the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My passion for food is something that I cherish. Food is always benevolent. No matter what mood I am in, I can always count on food. It is always tempting, always! I consider that no time limit or place, or anything in the world can stand in the way of tasting and getting the fill of my favourite meal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure that the thing which every host \u00e9lite like me misses or craves for is Ghar ka khaana. Ghar ka Khaana is more like comfort food for me. It is something which makes me eager to wait for weekends so that I can get home as soon as possible. Even the khichdis and the dal chawal which I used to dislike, before coming to the hostel is overly loved by me now. Mealtimes are something which is not less than a celebration at my house. Waking up to the smell of ghee masala dosa and vada idli was usual for me. My Amma loves cooking and she is no less than a great chef when it comes to that. She doesn\u2019t compromise with the taste. But after coming to the hostel, my taste buds have definitely started to compromise themselves to get used to the hostel food.<\/p><p>I like to call myself a foodie even after looking at the pretty numbers shown by my weighing machine. From sizzlers of Blueberrys to Dostana ki extra teekhi pani-puri, I have tried to cover everything in Nadiad. I\u2019m highly grateful to the online food services in Nadiad. They have been a total saviour from the hostel food. Trust me; the discounts given by these apps can sometimes give you more goose-bumps than binge-watching an entire season in one night.<\/p><p>I know most people consider food as secondary to happiness but not me! I think being happy is getting your fill of favourite food in the company of your favourite people. Nothing can beat that, nothing! Let\u2019s toast to that but before let me complete my slice of pizza.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-66d8a6d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"66d8a6d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-79faa7e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"79faa7e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d31b6ba elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"d31b6ba\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/SRUTHI-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yes, I\u2019m in love.

breaks. There are a pile of clothes sitting across me since last week. I can smell a certain foul smell around me which certainly must be due to my irregular shower schedule. I can feel my roommate&#8217;s disapproving glares burning on my back. The afternoon sunshine forces me to shut my eyes close. I am just about to fall back into another slumber when her face comes in front of my mind&#8217;s eye. The little energy I had gained since my last meal slowly fades away. I force myself to fall asleep harder, promising to not get up until all my problems have solved themselves. After an hour of unfulfilling sleep, I push myself up and into my clammy little washroom. The mirror greets me with her face, I splash cold water on my face trying to rub her mark off of me but once again her tired, sad, lifeless eyes stare back at me. I try to remember since when she started affecting me so much. I remember briefly meeting her on lonely Saturdays and how she was there for me when my trips back to home were canceled at last minute or how she lent her shoulder to try on during my fallouts with friends.<\/p><p>Oh, how na\u00efve I was to fall for her pretenses. She came in my life with the tag as &#8220;self-care&#8221; and ended up being like a parasite, sucking the life out of my soul. Maybe it was her scared eyes or love deprived heart that pulled me towards her. Or it could even be how well she knew and understood me. Of course, she would know me inside out, she was me after all, granted she was the sadder version of me but still me. During the start of our relationship, she would just meet me occasionally, and then I started noticing her being on my tail whenever I was out having fun. She didn\u2019t object much when I laughed at my friends\u2019 joke or during a fun movie but she would murmur to me how my laugh resembles a pig\u2019s snort and how I look like an ugly duckling among my friends. Her disapproval made me unable to even smile in front of others. Soon the invisible girl took the reins of my life and asked me to take a backseat.<\/p><p>I started bunking lectures and sleeping in on account of minor inconveniences. It old myself it was only because I was tired and won\u2019t be able to study in class with my headache. But soon those occasional bunks became frequent. I slept for 10hr sat a stretch almost every night but not ones in the morning did I ever feel refreshed. I got ready the same every day, not forgetting my hygiene once but my face had a strange sort of dullness. I couldn\u2019t understand what was taught in lectures and attended labs just for the sake of attendance.<\/p><p>The wrecked girl had started it all, smiling slyly in my shadow when I saw my disheartening internal results. \u201cStop it!\u201d my best friend had shouted at me. She had come to console me and I had really tried to listen but I could see her floating behind my friend. \u201cStop with those \u2018lost eyes\u2019 of yours,\u201d she said exasperated, \u201cthis has been going on for way to long. You hardly talk and on those rare occasions when you do, you won\u2019t look us in the eye. Whatever it is you are going through needs to stop.\u201d<\/p><p>That cold evening after I promised my friend I would med my ways, I called her. She wasn\u2019t someone who came on being called, she was the queen of her own mind. But there must have been something in my tone that she showed up. \u201cWho are you and why wouldn\u2019t you leave me alone.\u201d That was the day when she told me her name for the first time. She called herself depression. I was unable to accept the fact that I had been chilling out with depression since the past few weeks. The gravity of the situation finally hit me and I begged her to move out of my life and never show her face again. She simply laughed at my face and told me how I wouldn\u2019t survive without her. She wasn\u2019t wrong but I was willing to take the risk. \u201cYou are worthless\u201d, she told me. I lashed out at depression begging her through my blurred vision to leave me. But she stood her ground. Not moving an inch. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want this life\u201d, I cried. \u201cThen take it.\u201d She smirked. I gasped. After a few hours of pointless name-calling, I gave up. Like always.<\/p><p>It has been a whole week since that episode, and I have never felt so drained of energy in my whole life. But I haven&#8217;t completely given up yet. I am still adamant about not being depressed. I fall back on my unmade bed and pick up my barely charged phone and call my parents. Each passing ring shrinks my will power. \u201cHi, beta\u201d, those two words are enough for me to break down. In between my muffled sobs, I ask my parents to save me from her.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f061310 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f061310\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-848b797 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"848b797\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e5f0222 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e5f0222\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/DIVYESHREE-500x500-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Divyashree Iyer\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Divyashree Iyer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I haven&#8217;t got up from my bed since the last 15hrs, except for the occasional bathroom breaks.

that you are doing and look up. Look up at that ethereal multitude of colours. Look up at the sun rays piercing through the ginormous clouds. Look up at that big, blue, infinite sky. Or if it\u2019s dark, let the calling light of the moon fall onto your skin. Let the array of constellations show you the way to heaven. Close your eyes and feel every drop of the rain. In that moment, forget everything and everyone you know, because in some time it may not even matter. Feel the sky the way I feel it. Get lost in the infiniteness that will wrap around you even after you cease to exist.<br \/>We live busy lives. Or at least that is what we tell ourselves. Once upon a time, on one long day I took a moment to notice the sky. The bright blue was splotched by giant clouds. The sun shone on them in a way that made them look like angels watching over me. I was dumbstruck by its beauty. I felt tiny. For a long while, nothing seemed significant. I reflected upon my problems and wondered how many of them were even real. I felt something I never felt before. I stopped thinking of myself as a human, and thought of myself as a small part of the universe. In that moment, I devoted every fiber of my being to the sky.<br \/>\u201cOnce you have tasted the taste of sky, you will forever look up\u201d<br \/>-Leonardo da Vinci<br \/>From that day on, I began observing all the tiny little things about God\u2019s palette that made me love it even more. Forming dragons out of clouds, spotting constellations, waking up in the dead of the night to honor eclipses and meteor showers, and looking at hundreds of images of the northern lights because Norway is far away. There\u2019s only joy in every part of this journey. Once when I am hypnotized by it, I can think of nothing else. But of course, I can\u2019t stare at the sky all day. This little human has work to do. Yet, I can\u2019t think of anything that I can achieve, that could even come close to being significant.<br \/>Often I feel that most of what I do, or what all of us do won\u2019t even matter in the longer run. At times, I can\u2019t help but feel that my existence is useless. But when nothing else seems permanent, I know for sure that the sky \u2013 the universe is. It has been there long before we came, and it\u2019ll be there long after we are gone. For some reason, that gives me a sense of purpose.<br \/>The sky is the masterpiece of God. Yet, here we are lighting up fires and poking holes in its canvas. The sky is one of the few things that shows mercy on us. The sky is the only thing that shows mercy on this pale blue dot for a planet. It\u2019s about time we start respecting that.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3e3018b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"3e3018b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-fa61689 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"fa61689\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-03c8d96 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"03c8d96\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Khadija Sidhpuri\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Khadija Sidhpuri<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take a minute from whatever it is that you are doing and look up.

is a moment of greatness writing down this letter to you. I am a dedicated follower and an admirer of your thoughts and teachings, who have benefitted from the various masterclasses you conduct. Being a premier thinker on leadership, personal growth and life management you carry a huge responsibility of making life worth living, the easy way. &nbsp;As the saying goes, \u201cEven the darkest cloud has a silver lining\u201d your wisdom of words gave me that vision to fight against the toughest of the situations while progressing in life. \u201cMegaliving\u201d is the book that made me reconceptualize every aspect of life when it was topsy-turvy. The subtle touches of Indian philosophies and yoga in your texts kept me going with this book of yours, probably the first in this segment. It was an interesting read altogether. As a lawyer, you are very contemplative, which takes you to the depth of each and every aspect of a successful life and it reflects in your work ultimately.<\/p>\n<p>Robin sir, you are a pool of humbleness and positivity, I\u2019m really baffled to which quality of yours shall I inculcate first. Motivation and self-help segment was not my cup of tea until I was gifted with your bestselling titles\u201d The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\u201d by my uncle. Till today it holds the prestige of being one of my favorite reads. When it comes to your genre of writing, many of my mates criticized some piece of your works, for having very long procedures in attaining a quality, which hits them with boredom. I wish if you could inculcate some simple stories for conveying your thought, because as a reader that would deepen the interest in reading the book. In this fastmoving world, nobody has the time to read a book and have the patience to follow the 30 days procedure. Frankly, I won\u2019t be able to do it myself. We can\u2019t change so easily. Our mind is set in a way to react, to what we feel is right. Hope you consider this tiny suggestion. There is surely more to learn from you, then to accept failure and loose at life. Mr. Sharma, you always show appreciation for your parents and family, who support you and give your wisdom of thought a new edge. The following lines from -The Mastery Manual: \u201cRemember there are no real-life failures in life only results. There are no true tragedies, only lessons. And there are no problems only opportunities for growth waiting to be recognized as a solution by the person of wisdom&#8221;, shall remain eternal. It&#8217;s not me who\u2019s appreciating you and your works, but the people from lowest designation in an office to CEOs of big corporate houses are present in that successful fraternity. More of an author then a lawyer your Style is interactive, not didactic. You know how some people are, who inspire from their own energy and lifestyle. You do that.<\/p>\n<p>Sir, the more I learn from you, the more positive and productive I become at life. After all, life is all about taking birth, fulfilling your task and saying good-bye, you add something more in between the latter two phases making it a meaningful and an exciting one. You have helped a lot through your words in raising the bar and unleashing the true potential within me. As you quoted in your book- \u201cThe Mastery Manual\u201d, &#8220;The tragedy of life is not death but what we let die inside of us while we live&#8221;, makes all the difference of rising up once again and achieving our goal. I admire you and your works, and I\u2019m very grateful for all the change that has happened.<\/p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,<\/p>\n<p>Vrajal Chokshi<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e2191a8 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"e2191a8\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-78972e3 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"78972e3\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9911278 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"9911278\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/VRAJAL-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Vrajal Chokshi\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Vrajal Chokshi<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> IT, 5th Sem<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Respected Robin Sharma, It is a moment of greatness writing down this letter to you.

\u201cMexican!\u201d \u201cMexican!\u201d the only word I used to preach to my grandma as a kid whenever I wanted to eat Mexican, so much so that I came to be called as the \u2018bhukkad\u2019 of the house. \u2018Enchiladas\u2019 was the emotion behind the word \u2018Mexican\u2019, but my younger self didn\u2019t know what it was called at the time. Having little or no idea about what Mexican was or what I was screaming about, she always nodded and smiled, and without a word, she went into the kitchen and made me her world-famous chole that everyone was a die-hard fan of. Only with a twist, the name \u2018Mexican\u2019 and lots of love was added with the chole; and so it was called \u2019The Mexican Chole\u2019. I wish I could rebel the fact that it was not what I had asked for. But the glare in my mother\u2019s eyes, which only said that it would be disrespectful of me to reject what I had been given, accompanied by the fresh, tantalizing aroma emerging out of it, always prevailed over its physical appearance and held me under shackles so tight that I could not revolt but eat. I remember I always fell in love with it.<\/p><p>Be it a festival, a weekend, a frantic day at sports class or a day when my exam results came out, all days had the same feeling- Mexican. I yearned for enchiladas and my grandma made me the Mexican Chole instead. The kid in me easily got flattered and I almost completely forgot that I had been so badly craving for enchiladas until this time, and got lost in the enchantment of the explosion of numerous flavors cast upon my taste buds. It was a dish filled with sentiments; emotions of love, affection, tranquillity, hope, enthusiasm and amusement. Hope, as she probably wished that I would like it and that she never gets tired of impressing me. Amusement, because I had to pretend that it was what I had asked for.<\/p><p>Years passed by. My cravings for enchiladas grew strong, but for the Mexican chole- stronger. I grew old and granny- older. I realised how troublesome I had been to her until this time, wanting her to fulfill my inexplicable demands. I noticed why she gave in to my wishes. It was never because she was old, but because she did everything for me out of love. How much she loved making people happy and how content she felt watching those happy faces while they ate her straight-out-of-heart chole and me, her Mexican chole.<\/p><p>Now that she is no more, I have never asked for the Mexican chole. I couldn\u2019t accept the signature dish of my grandma being made by anybody else. If there\u2019s one thing that has kept the bond between my grandma and me still alive in my heart, it is the Mexican Chole. The feeling still majestic, the taste still refined, the aroma still airy.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element

stop staring at the sky. We are getting late for our lectures.\u201d Somehow my friends and I managed to reach the class on time, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes away from the window, watching the tiny drops, dancing their way down. Locked in a trance, I wondered how much importance a drop of water holds in my life.<\/p><p>Glancing at the rain outside the window, I remembered the mesmerizing feeling of raindrops falling on my face and breathing the earthy mist. For me, these raindrops are full of life and they shower love on everyone, though many can\u2019t feel it. Today when these tiny droplets of rain came in contact with my skin, it felt like they were talking to me, narrating me the journey of their formation. They washed all my pain and left behind a trail of good memories which, unlike them, can never be wiped off.<\/p><p>After the rain stopped, seeing the water droplets falling off the leaves reminded me of dew. Waking up early in the morning and watching the crystal clear dew drops soothes my mind and makes me believe that there can be absolute clarity if you refine your vision. Whenever I see these dewdrops dancing at edges and sliding with great ease, they inspire me that they are not afraid of falling from that great height and yet keep on smiling. These wonderful particles of droplets are gems of the morning and without seeing them my morning is incomplete. I feel that dew like human tears are the tears of the leaves which are shed at night and wiped off early in the morning.<\/p><p>Speaking of tears, when my heart is heavy with emotions, they come out of my eyes bursting out like rain. Tears are always there for me but come into action when my heart wants to speak and my lips no longer describe my feelings. Sometimes, they just roll down my cheeks in the form of unspoken happiness. Many a time, they start pouring even when I don\u2019t feel like crying but they convey what is hidden in my heart. My tears are more special to me than my smiles as they are reserved for only those whom I really love. It is rightly said that a drop of rain can melt a heart but a drop of tear can melt the toughest soul.<\/p><p>Regardless of it being in the form of rain or dewdrops, every time a drop appears in my presence, it ensures that I am happy. This is true even when the drop is in the form of a tear running down my cheek. Individually (as in dewdrop) or together (as in rain or tears) they are unbreakable and share a very strong bond and an essence worth remembering. They are just an inevitable part of my life. Sometimes, I wonder is it the drop that inspires me or the happiness that it carries with it?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc4342b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"dc4342b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-e8595f2 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"e8595f2\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-96077ff elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"96077ff\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Aastha Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Aastha Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cCome on Aastha, buckle up, stop staring at the sky.
