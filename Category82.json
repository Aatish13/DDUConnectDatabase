She never understands me. She needs to apologize first !\u201d said my ego. And here is another victory for you. Congratulations!!! Ego.<\/p><p>\u00a0I started realising that these small fights are increasing day by day over small matters and sometimes without any reason. It was me who took the initiative and apologised to her keeping all our issues aside and finally after three days we had a friendly conversation.<\/p><p>Today, while sitting ideally near the window, enjoying the sunset and having spent another boring and unproductive quarantine day, I realised that Ego, you and I share an invisible yet an emotional bond. It was you who stopped me from crying when I hugged my brother for the last time when he was going away from me to a whole new country for further studies. It is you who stops me from messaging a friend first seeing him online. It is you who encouraged me to do photography even after reading the signboard, \u201cPHOTOGRAPHY STRICTLY PROHIBITED\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>And now thinking endlessly, I figured out that Ego, you always have an easy way out. You are always ready with a plan . You always compel me to pursue a wrong decision for all the wrong reasons you have. And not only that you also hide the working of real love from me by stimulating my senses and making me feel good about my every wrong deed.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how but sometimes you make me more powerful. For a moment I feel that I have everything\u00a0 But this feeling doesn\u2019t last long as sooner or later I realise that I am wrong and was tricked by you to fall into a trap.<\/p><p>As the days pass by, the real me is getting replaced by an egoistic me. You have proven to be toxic for me, whose extreme dosage would have devastating consequences on me.<\/p><p>The more I try to stay away from our toxic relationship, more and more I get attracted towards you making our bond, even more, stronger than before.<\/p><p># My ego writes the cheque that my body can&#8217;t cash.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-095d243 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"095d243\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-8cf55cb elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"8cf55cb\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6695bdb elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"6695bdb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Aastha Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Aastha Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE 4th SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The entire day, while sitting in my bedroom, I was trying to concentrate on my work.

me not to mess up my study table with watercolours. Hence, the closest thing similar to a table I could think of were stairs. \n\nI was eight and we led a simple life in a simple house near the busy market. We had these archaic wooden staircases, with seemingly high pitch line. So, I\u2019d take my weapons, that is my paint brushes and scurry off to the chocolate brown cases. I\u2019d place my stuff on one stair and sit on the next stair lower to it and I\u2019d begin the sorcery. It\u2019s funny how cold it felt beneath my skin, but still I found that tingly feel really amusing. The best part was having my lunch there because who wouldn&#8217;t like to eat with a TV on, promisingly at a level higher from the ground. \n\nThe other place where I loved to run my chores was in the backyard. The stairs there were rubble blocks made of cement which lead to a store room and for the cherry on top, it had a cement handrail. So presently if you\u2019re an adult but had never tried sliding down a handrail, then your childhood had been a sham. The best part of my childhood was there, near the dusty stairs with my cousins, building forts of mattresses and chairs and playing all day long till we looked like scarecrows and someone had to drag us out of there. We&#8217;d occasionally play the classic perpetual game of \u2018how many staircases can you skip?\u2019 and of course tripping over until one of us sprains a joint. \n\nTime passed and we decided to build ourselves a new home. I was mad as a hatter to know as to how the stairs will turn to look like. To be honest, I was more excited for the stairs than my own room. They looked like the ones you see or read about in the Greek or Roman mythology, except these were black marble instead of blinding white. Spiral staircases with two openings. I always felt it tough to decide as to which side to take to reach my room. Mother and I would decorate them with diyas during Diwali and they looked magnificent. I&#8217;d remove my glasses off and look at the beautiful bokeh it set in front of my eyes. \n\nAfter all these years, I&#8217;ve grown up and I live by myself in my hostel. Yet I still find myself sitting on the hostel stairs preparing for exams. My roommates would ask if I&#8217;m uncomfortable in studying around them but perhaps it is an old habit to find stairs for solace. As of now, while I&#8217;m writing this, I&#8217;m still seated on the grey blocks. I guess they really meant it when they said that beauty is in the eyes of beholder. From soup to nut, my childhood revolved around the ups and downs of stairs. And I still look forward on sitting on more staircases at more places, counting the number of stairs!  And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m clairvoyant about that!  \n<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d83b92b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"d83b92b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-9f76311 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"9f76311\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5a7d05a elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"5a7d05a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/PRIYA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Priya Rathod \">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod <\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It all started when my grandmother told me not to mess up my study table with watercolours.

fade&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Empty pockets don\u2019t ever make the grade &#8230;.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is all I remember. My mother used to sing me this lullaby which she says her mother used to sing it to her. It\u2019s been 16 years since my mother died and this incomplete, half-remembered lullaby is the only memory I have of her.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today at work, the hours of my day went passing by without a whimper or a cry and wrapping up for the day while drifting in my thoughts, I reminiscence it- the lullaby. Maybe for an instance, the time had stopped, while I felt engulfed by my mother\u2019s hug and scent and my mind drifted back to the time when she used to buy me cotton candies and then we spent the day aimlessly at the dock counting the ships and dreaming of chasing butterflies one day.<\/p>\n<p>The sun was setting down today bright and shiny, yet subtle. It looked kind and at peace and made me feel at ease, the way my mother used to make me feel and again I memorized the lullaby because that\u2019s the only string which keeps me connected to my mother. My skin felt the sun\u2019s warmth and my heart smiled. The sun waved back at me as I waved it goodbye.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the sun set down, it brought darkness and fear with it. The moon was yet to rise and it was darkness all around. It made me freak out, panicked and I wanted to scream out loud but then I tried to remember the lullaby my mother used to sing to me when I was afraid. The words started flowing in my mind giving me strength and courage to stand against the dark. But this time it was different as I was all alone without my mother. But the lullaby kept on giving me strength and making me strong every moment so that I rise and become powerful enough to withstand the world all by myself.<\/p><p>This lullaby has not only taught me to be strong but, it has also inculcated some traditional values in me which I think makes my mother more than happy. At every step of my life whenever I needed my mother all I need to do was to memorize the lullaby in my mind and then at next moment I find my mother standing next to me holding my hands, supporting me. I don\u2019t know but the lullaby was so hypnotic that it made me want to listen to it daily and maybe it was my mother\u2019s voice which made it more musical.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element

In deep, untamed, uninhibited love that runs deep in my veins and stomach for that matter. I was at the doorstep, making my debut entrance at the La Pino\u2019z. The irresistible smell, the aroma of flavours and the rich colours and everything else in the restaurant had me under control. I said to myself \u201cSruthi; this is gonna be the love of your life. Hold it tight and never let it go.\u201d Well; for me the love of my life is not a human being rather is the different delicacies existing in the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>My passion for food is something that I cherish. Food is always benevolent. No matter what mood I am in, I can always count on food. It is always tempting, always! I consider that no time limit or place, or anything in the world can stand in the way of tasting and getting the fill of my favourite meal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty sure that the thing which every host \u00e9lite like me misses or craves for is Ghar ka khaana. Ghar ka Khaana is more like comfort food for me. It is something which makes me eager to wait for weekends so that I can get home as soon as possible. Even the khichdis and the dal chawal which I used to dislike, before coming to the hostel is overly loved by me now. Mealtimes are something which is not less than a celebration at my house. Waking up to the smell of ghee masala dosa and vada idli was usual for me. My Amma loves cooking and she is no less than a great chef when it comes to that. She doesn\u2019t compromise with the taste. But after coming to the hostel, my taste buds have definitely started to compromise themselves to get used to the hostel food.<\/p><p>I like to call myself a foodie even after looking at the pretty numbers shown by my weighing machine. From sizzlers of Blueberrys to Dostana ki extra teekhi pani-puri, I have tried to cover everything in Nadiad. I\u2019m highly grateful to the online food services in Nadiad. They have been a total saviour from the hostel food. Trust me; the discounts given by these apps can sometimes give you more goose-bumps than binge-watching an entire season in one night.<\/p><p>I know most people consider food as secondary to happiness but not me! I think being happy is getting your fill of favourite food in the company of your favourite people. Nothing can beat that, nothing! Let\u2019s toast to that but before let me complete my slice of pizza.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-66d8a6d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"66d8a6d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-79faa7e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"79faa7e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d31b6ba elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"d31b6ba\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/SRUTHI-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yes, I\u2019m in love.

that you are doing and look up. Look up at that ethereal multitude of colours. Look up at the sun rays piercing through the ginormous clouds. Look up at that big, blue, infinite sky. Or if it\u2019s dark, let the calling light of the moon fall onto your skin. Let the array of constellations show you the way to heaven. Close your eyes and feel every drop of the rain. In that moment, forget everything and everyone you know, because in some time it may not even matter. Feel the sky the way I feel it. Get lost in the infiniteness that will wrap around you even after you cease to exist.<br \/>We live busy lives. Or at least that is what we tell ourselves. Once upon a time, on one long day I took a moment to notice the sky. The bright blue was splotched by giant clouds. The sun shone on them in a way that made them look like angels watching over me. I was dumbstruck by its beauty. I felt tiny. For a long while, nothing seemed significant. I reflected upon my problems and wondered how many of them were even real. I felt something I never felt before. I stopped thinking of myself as a human, and thought of myself as a small part of the universe. In that moment, I devoted every fiber of my being to the sky.<br \/>\u201cOnce you have tasted the taste of sky, you will forever look up\u201d<br \/>-Leonardo da Vinci<br \/>From that day on, I began observing all the tiny little things about God\u2019s palette that made me love it even more. Forming dragons out of clouds, spotting constellations, waking up in the dead of the night to honor eclipses and meteor showers, and looking at hundreds of images of the northern lights because Norway is far away. There\u2019s only joy in every part of this journey. Once when I am hypnotized by it, I can think of nothing else. But of course, I can\u2019t stare at the sky all day. This little human has work to do. Yet, I can\u2019t think of anything that I can achieve, that could even come close to being significant.<br \/>Often I feel that most of what I do, or what all of us do won\u2019t even matter in the longer run. At times, I can\u2019t help but feel that my existence is useless. But when nothing else seems permanent, I know for sure that the sky \u2013 the universe is. It has been there long before we came, and it\u2019ll be there long after we are gone. For some reason, that gives me a sense of purpose.<br \/>The sky is the masterpiece of God. Yet, here we are lighting up fires and poking holes in its canvas. The sky is one of the few things that shows mercy on us. The sky is the only thing that shows mercy on this pale blue dot for a planet. It\u2019s about time we start respecting that.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3e3018b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"3e3018b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-fa61689 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"fa61689\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-03c8d96 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"03c8d96\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Khadija Sidhpuri\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Khadija Sidhpuri<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Take a minute from whatever it is that you are doing and look up.

\u201cMexican!\u201d \u201cMexican!\u201d the only word I used to preach to my grandma as a kid whenever I wanted to eat Mexican, so much so that I came to be called as the \u2018bhukkad\u2019 of the house. \u2018Enchiladas\u2019 was the emotion behind the word \u2018Mexican\u2019, but my younger self didn\u2019t know what it was called at the time. Having little or no idea about what Mexican was or what I was screaming about, she always nodded and smiled, and without a word, she went into the kitchen and made me her world-famous chole that everyone was a die-hard fan of. Only with a twist, the name \u2018Mexican\u2019 and lots of love was added with the chole; and so it was called \u2019The Mexican Chole\u2019. I wish I could rebel the fact that it was not what I had asked for. But the glare in my mother\u2019s eyes, which only said that it would be disrespectful of me to reject what I had been given, accompanied by the fresh, tantalizing aroma emerging out of it, always prevailed over its physical appearance and held me under shackles so tight that I could not revolt but eat. I remember I always fell in love with it.<\/p><p>Be it a festival, a weekend, a frantic day at sports class or a day when my exam results came out, all days had the same feeling- Mexican. I yearned for enchiladas and my grandma made me the Mexican Chole instead. The kid in me easily got flattered and I almost completely forgot that I had been so badly craving for enchiladas until this time, and got lost in the enchantment of the explosion of numerous flavors cast upon my taste buds. It was a dish filled with sentiments; emotions of love, affection, tranquillity, hope, enthusiasm and amusement. Hope, as she probably wished that I would like it and that she never gets tired of impressing me. Amusement, because I had to pretend that it was what I had asked for.<\/p><p>Years passed by. My cravings for enchiladas grew strong, but for the Mexican chole- stronger. I grew old and granny- older. I realised how troublesome I had been to her until this time, wanting her to fulfill my inexplicable demands. I noticed why she gave in to my wishes. It was never because she was old, but because she did everything for me out of love. How much she loved making people happy and how content she felt watching those happy faces while they ate her straight-out-of-heart chole and me, her Mexican chole.<\/p><p>Now that she is no more, I have never asked for the Mexican chole. I couldn\u2019t accept the signature dish of my grandma being made by anybody else. If there\u2019s one thing that has kept the bond between my grandma and me still alive in my heart, it is the Mexican Chole. The feeling still majestic, the taste still refined, the aroma still airy.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element

stop staring at the sky. We are getting late for our lectures.\u201d Somehow my friends and I managed to reach the class on time, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes away from the window, watching the tiny drops, dancing their way down. Locked in a trance, I wondered how much importance a drop of water holds in my life.<\/p><p>Glancing at the rain outside the window, I remembered the mesmerizing feeling of raindrops falling on my face and breathing the earthy mist. For me, these raindrops are full of life and they shower love on everyone, though many can\u2019t feel it. Today when these tiny droplets of rain came in contact with my skin, it felt like they were talking to me, narrating me the journey of their formation. They washed all my pain and left behind a trail of good memories which, unlike them, can never be wiped off.<\/p><p>After the rain stopped, seeing the water droplets falling off the leaves reminded me of dew. Waking up early in the morning and watching the crystal clear dew drops soothes my mind and makes me believe that there can be absolute clarity if you refine your vision. Whenever I see these dewdrops dancing at edges and sliding with great ease, they inspire me that they are not afraid of falling from that great height and yet keep on smiling. These wonderful particles of droplets are gems of the morning and without seeing them my morning is incomplete. I feel that dew like human tears are the tears of the leaves which are shed at night and wiped off early in the morning.<\/p><p>Speaking of tears, when my heart is heavy with emotions, they come out of my eyes bursting out like rain. Tears are always there for me but come into action when my heart wants to speak and my lips no longer describe my feelings. Sometimes, they just roll down my cheeks in the form of unspoken happiness. Many a time, they start pouring even when I don\u2019t feel like crying but they convey what is hidden in my heart. My tears are more special to me than my smiles as they are reserved for only those whom I really love. It is rightly said that a drop of rain can melt a heart but a drop of tear can melt the toughest soul.<\/p><p>Regardless of it being in the form of rain or dewdrops, every time a drop appears in my presence, it ensures that I am happy. This is true even when the drop is in the form of a tear running down my cheek. Individually (as in dewdrop) or together (as in rain or tears) they are unbreakable and share a very strong bond and an essence worth remembering. They are just an inevitable part of my life. Sometimes, I wonder is it the drop that inspires me or the happiness that it carries with it?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc4342b elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"dc4342b\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-e8595f2 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"e8595f2\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-96077ff elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"96077ff\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Aastha Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Aastha Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cCome on Aastha, buckle up, stop staring at the sky.

using them for hours at stretch. My earphones have never failed to hurt me after a Friends season ends. But to get the pleasure of being left alone, one has to pay the price. I pay this price every time I feel like leaving this world behind by using my earphones as a means to travel to another dimension. It transforms into a portkey when I listen to a Harry Potter audio book or into a Golden Chariot during storms when Hanuman Chalisaa plays in the background. Earlier it used to be an escape but now, it has become an integral part of my life.<\/p><p>I had first found them in my mother\u2019s drawer just a few days before my college started. They were nothing more than a stubborn pair of tangled wires back then. It wasn&#8217;t until my bus rides to home increased that I started using them as a way to escape strangers&#8217; silent stares. With soft music playing in my ears and the beautiful scenery passing by, my life seemed nothing short of a Zoya Akhtar movie. Slowly, they entered into my night routine. With the ever-increasing journal submissions and proportionally decreasing motivational level, I needed something to keep me on track. In came the &#8217;90s and &#8217;70s romantic playlist which made my insomniac nights easier and soon those white earphones became a part of me.<\/p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before I realised how mysterious they really were. They had ways to transform a sad, post break up mood into a more socially accepted stoic one. They made me slide in my parent&#8217;s bed at night after it elevated the effects of a horror movie. They evoke a foreign emotion when I noticed my roommate looking longingly at me and my laptop as I watched Netflix a day before her sessionals. Google titles this feeling as being sadistic. I felt my mother&#8217;s presence miles away from home with our innumerable video calls. After a long day at college I unwind myself\u00a0 lounging in bed with my earphones in and a stand-up comedy playing on my mobile.<\/p><p>But it wasn\u2019t always like this. There was a time when I used to be intimidated by people walking down the pathway with wires dangling down their ears. Now I am on the other side of the road. I still have to find out if this much craving for a thing will actually be beneficial for me. But right now, I am a bit busy with tasks which require my white wires within an arms distance.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d922397 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"d922397\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-cca9080 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"cca9080\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-afc26ca elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"afc26ca\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Divyashree Iyer\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Divyashree Iyer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My ears have been left sore after using them for hours at stretch.

now?&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;Saudi Arabia.&#8221;<br \/>When I was expecting mom to say USA or something, she said a name I\u2019d never heard of. I was seven years old when my dad landed a job in Yanbu, KSA. Of course, being in a plane, getting to live abroad excited me beyond limits. But it was only after we moved there, that I realized that I would never be able to see my old friends or even go back to my old home again.<br \/>Moving to Saudi felt like moving to a different planet. From the language to the inverted traffic lights, everything was new. Saturday became the first day of school instead of the last. The cartoons I loved started talking English instead of Hindi. &#8220;Maafi Arabic,&#8221; \u2013 was the only Arabic sentence I knew and spoke, which means &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak Arabic.&#8221; The part I hated was that there were zero theatres in the country. More than anything else, I wanted to go back to my old home.<br \/>Yet, my surroundings found an easy way to distract me from my hatred. Each detail of this new planet was fascinating and overwhelming. I began to see beauty in things I despised. The evergreen trees and grassy hills were replaced by sand dunes and rocky mountains. Getting lost while exploring the enormous shopping malls was nothing less than a treasure quest. The gigantic Arabian horses never ceased to amuse me. The beaches were the best of all!<br \/>Coming from a land that is known for its rivers, I found most odd that Saudi had zero rivers or freshwater lakes. We were lucky to be living in a coastal city. When I first went to the beach, it was love at first sight. Splashing around the infinite shoreline and collecting seashells became a weekend thing. I still have daydreams about sitting on the wet sand, gazing at the sunset, with a shawarma in one hand and a can of &#8216;bebsi&#8217; in another. The breathtaking motorboat and buggy rides were the cherry on top. Walking over sand dunes and having your feet engulfed in the fine sand was scary and ticklish at the same time. I was fascinated by this new costume called burqa, but sadly I was too young to get one myself.<br \/>After having lived in KSA for four years, it was time to move back to homeland India. This meant, losing all my friends again and starting over. I hated that part of the process. I felt sorry for many of my new classmates who asked me how I could survive in Saudi for that long, who thought of it as a place where all fun goes to die. They had only seen the black part of the picture. Sure, the country had its flaws, but who doesn\u2019t? For as long as we lived there, I had only known happiness, respect, security and above all unrivaled experiences. Four years may not be long enough to call it home, but I spent a lifetime over there.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e0c7a73 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e0c7a73\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Khadija Sidhpuri\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Khadija Sidhpuri<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;So where are we going to live now?&#8221;&#8220;Saudi Arabia.&#8221;When I was expecting mom to say USA or something, she said a name I\u2019d never heard of.

from my music library\u201d- these were the first words, I heard when I entered my home from my mundane Hostel for Diwali vacation. Amazon echo or \u201cHamari pyaari Alexa\u201d came to my house this July. My brother received it as a gift from his industry, and he re-gifted it to my parents. In the beginning, my parents found it difficult to talk to her and I thought the next time I come home, I&#8217;ll find her in dust in one of the corners in my small house. Well, I was totally mistaken. When I came back home, I realized that they were completely obsessed with her. Their day started with her and ended with her.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Despite these facts, Alexa didn&#8217;t raise my interest in it. In my mind it was just a conversational bot and how exciting could that be? I already know that I could ask Alexa things, something I should get used to. But I&#8217;m not much of a talker when it comes to speaking to inanimate objects. On the last day of my Diwali vacation, I heard my mom asking her, \u201cAlexa, honey could you please stop the music\u201d. A sudden rush of thought came to my mind that Alexa gets spoken to better than me, and she was not even real. I went straight to her and said loudly, \u201cHey Alexa, I don&#8217;t like you\u201d. Prompt came the response \u201cI am really sorry to hear that. You can always send feedback through the help and feedback section through the Alexa app.\u201d Well; at least everyone in the house had a hearty laugh.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>It\u2019s not that I hate Alexa, but the factuality that how artificial intelligence has taken over our lives makes me bothersome. I know artificial intelligence is the future waiting for us and of course, it is beneficial. But somewhere deep I think it will shatter the thin line between reality and fantasy. Many people, including the late physicist Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns that the rise of powerful AI systems could spell the end for humanity. The fact that AI is dubbed \u201cintelligent\u201d is ultimately down to the fact that it can learn. But even when it comes to learning, it is no match for humans. In fact, toddlers can learn by just watching somebody solving a problem once. An AI, on the other hand, needs tonnes of data and loads of tries to succeed on very specific problems.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are tools. They can be used in a right or a wrong way, like everything else. It is the way that they are used that should concern us, not the methods themselves. Human greed and human ignorance scare me far more than artificial intelligence does.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b0c5e97 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"b0c5e97\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-982d06e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"982d06e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-36320ab elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"36320ab\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/20190419_173003-e1555953589690-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 2nd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cHey Alexa, play songs from my music library\u201d- these were the first words, I heard when I entered my home from my mundane Hostel for Diwali vacation.
