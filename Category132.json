He has 21 years of experience in medical field. He has expertise in General Orthopaedic surgery, orthopaedic consultation and Arthroscopy. He completed MBBS from Bharti Vidhyapeeth medical college.<\/p><p>1. Why did you choose to be a doctor specialized in orthopaedics, was it a childhood dream, or there was a turning point in your life?<\/p><p>I wanted to become gynaecologist first and not orthopaedic. During that time orthopaedics was related to surgery mark and my surgery marks were better than my gynaecology marks. Due to that I couldn&#8217;t manage gynaec seat. Now I love orthopaedics. &#8220;No regrets now.&#8221;<\/p><p>2. How do you co-relate your passion as an orthopaedics surgeon with meditation?<\/p><p>Heartfulness had a positive impact on me that is, it has made me more passionate towards my profession. 8 years back I felt my life was monotonous. I was even the executive member for orthopaedic society of Pune. Somewhere I wasn&#8217;t enjoying. After my introduction to heartfulness institution, I realized that each day was like a movie for me and I started enjoying each day better. My patients saw the change in me. I am happy and I am able to spread more happiness due to heartfulness<\/p><p>3. Is meditation based on any religion, or is it just a form of spirituality, and why?<\/p><p>It is form of spirituality. Heartfulness doesn\u2019t represent any religion. It helps you to connect to your inner self and to higher self.<\/p><p>4. Apart from your interest in surgery and medicine, what are you most passionate about?<\/p><p>I love reading books. I often go on treks as well as scuba diving. I go for scuba diving once in every 3 months.<\/p><p>5. To be a successful orthopaedic which tips would you like to give to our budding doctors?<\/p><p>Always remember to stay truthful to oneself. Stay true to your profession and to your patients. That is the key for success.<\/p><p>6. What would you like to say to the readers of DDU Connect?<\/p><p>Tell them to join &#8216;US&#8217;. Tell them to join heartfulness. I would like them to enjoy life.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

Dr. Rahul Mehrotra practices at Medanta &#8211; Mediclinic Cybercity in DLF Phase II,\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Gurgaon. He completed MBBS from Dr. S.N. Medical College, Jodhpur in 1996, MD &#8211; Medicine\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">from Dr. S.N. Medical College, Jodhpur in 2002, and DNB (Cardiology) from Escorts Heart\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Institute &amp; Research Centre in 2005. He is a member of the Cardiological Society of India (CSI),\u00a0<\/span>the American Society of Echocardiography, and the Indian Academy of Echocardiography.<\/p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0<\/span>1.You are a cardiologist. Was it a childhood dream or turning point in your life?<\/p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I was good at maths as well as biology in my 10th grade. I even scored 100% in mathematics\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">but I had a deep interest in biology although I never thought of becoming a cardiologist. After my\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">MBBS I gave service to patients which made me feel very happy and satisfied. Soon after that, I\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">chose Microbiology in AIIMS despite the opposition of my parents and relatives. Soon after that,\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">I realized that my happiness is with patients and not the research. So with the guidance of my\u00a0<\/span>professor, I took Cardiology for my specialization.<\/p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">2. One of your achievements is to get a gold medal for the best research paper. Can you please\u00a0<\/span>tell us more about your research paper?<\/p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Our research was related to the heartfulness meditation system. IIT Delhi got interested in\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">it and worked along with us. We asked people aged above 30 to volunteer for the research. We took\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">an average of 30 minutes of blood pressure, heartbeats, and ECG. Again after 30 minutes, we\u00a0<\/span>took another round of tests. The time allotted for research in hospital was 2pm to 5 pm. We observed that as soon as we meditate, parasympathetic nervous system gets activated which is associated with positive senses. So even if people think that meditation doesn&#8217;t affect them mentally, it has a physiological impact.<\/p><p>3. What would you like to convey to our readers?<\/p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\">You should have a very critical and scientific mind. Read and think about the system to which\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">you are trying to adapt. Give a logical explanation to yourself. Take any work, practice it for\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">12-16 weeks, and then decide whether it makes you happy or not. Be very honest and true to\u00a0<\/span>yourself.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

He started developing interest in writing while he was pursuing his graduation and thereafter, he went on t<span lang=\"en-US\">o become an accomplished<\/span> poet. He undertook the journey of writing the book \u2018A Roundabout \u2013 Dreams and Thoughts\u2019, a collection of his poems, because he strongly believes that dreams symbolize the desire of youth to change the world. Team DDU Connect got an opportunity to interview him. Here are the excerpts from the same.<\/p><p>1. What inspired you to write so many poems?<\/p><p>&#8220;It started with a dream to achieve something and to make a small impact on the people around me. So, I started penning down poems as I thought that writing would be a great medium to achieve my dream. I thought that it would be great if I am able to make a good collection of poems that can be published. After gaining confidence, I made up my mind to publish a book at some point in my life. So, I gradually started writing more with that motive.&#8221;<\/p><p>2. When you started writing poems, were there any difficulties you faced as a writer?<\/p><p>&#8220;A few difficulties were faced, like, to contemplate over a thought for writing poetry or write-up on a topic needed much concentration, content and time. But after writing some write-ups I was able to make that process smooth. Additionally, it took a while approaching the DDU Connect team in the start and getting a chance to publish my write-up for the first time. When my work got to be acknowledged by the readers of DDU, it wa<span lang=\"en-US\">s a smooth affair <\/span>after that.&#8221;<\/p><p>3. How would you describe your journey from the very beginning to getting your book published?<\/p><p>&#8220;When I started to write, I wrote some write-ups and thought to share it somewhere. I got to know about a section in DDU Connect where they publish the write-ups of our fellow students. I got a chance there and then I went on a streak to publish more write-ups there itself. In one Connect edition<span lang=\"en-US\">,<\/span> I saw a section about &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221;. At that moment I asked my friends, Connect members, about how to get featured there. On knowing that it required more contributions in a year, I tried to achieve that and indeed I got a feature. In addition to that, my work was also published in other reputed universities&#8217; tabloid<span lang=\"en-US\">s<\/span> like Nirma University&#8217;s rotary club Annual Magazine. The contributions and features like these boosted my confidence to leap further for making a good collection of poems for my book.<\/p><p>I recall a time in 2016 when I had mailed the top-notch publishers of India and asked them about how to get a poetry book published. Only one of them, The Write Place publishers, replied<span lang=\"en-US\"> to<\/span> me that it will need a minimum of 60 poems for a book. I was writing at a slower pace, with merely 30 in my hand till 7th semester of my engineering. On realizing that it would be difficult to write while doing a job or getting admitted to a B-school, I started shooting up the counter soon. On having a collection of somewhat 60-65 I started reaching out publishers. After several attempts and waiting nearly 8-9 months, a mail of &#8220;We would like to have you on board to publish and market your book&#8221; brought satisfaction to the spark within. The journey from start to getting published was a good experience overall, with expected and unexpected turns.&#8221;<\/p><p>4. What motivated you to reach this challenging milestone?<\/p><p>&#8220;A lofty dream dreamt at th<span lang=\"en-US\">at<\/span> moment to publish the book. The same d<span lang=\"en-US\">ream<\/span> helped me go further for publishing my first book, \u2018A Roundabout &#8211; Thoughts and Dreams\u2019.&#8221;<\/p><p>5. Does writing energize or exhaust you?<\/p><p>&#8220;Exhaust would be a negative word. Writing is a kind of art just like dancing, acting, music and such others. Art always energizes us.&#8221;<\/p><p>6. What did you learn while writing this book?<\/p><p>&#8220;While studying in school we came across terms like determination, focus, consistency, hard work and such others but only <span lang=\"en-US\">a <\/span>few times we realize what they actually are. This was one of that time when I got to know a little bit<span lang=\"en-US\"> of<\/span> taste of all of them.&#8221;<\/p><p>7. Have you planned any future endeavours relating to writing or publishing?<\/p><p>&#8220;After completing the content of this poetry book, I was very enthusiastic about writing a novel but as of now, I haven&#8217;t started anything yet. I\u2019ll start drafting it when I have good content to be written about.&#8221;<\/p><p>8. Did you ever feel like quitting?<\/p><p><a name=\"_GoBack\"><\/a>&#8220;Have you ever heard that a person has never had the thought of quitting, be it on a small or big project? Likewise, I also felt that I am not going good with my writing and am not able to find more of the good content. I also thought that I should focus more on studies, so at least that would be served better. But that dream dreamt at the start pinched many times and I went on slowly to achieve this. In the end, I was able to put up a decent amount of collection for the book.&#8221;<\/p><p>9. Any message that you&#8217;d like to convey to our readers?<\/p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get distracted from the thing that you are doing whole-heartedly. Small steps prove to be phenomenal in the long run, keep going with the instincts you believe in. You have to go \u2018Far Far Away!\u2019 &#8220;<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sagar Patel, an engineer with a perspective of a poet, completed his graduation in Computer engineering from Dharmasinh Desai University.

So only 1-2% is left behind and we are trying our best to fill that gap too.\u201d<\/p><p lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">2)What are the improvements that the club has witnessed in terms of <span lang=\"en-US\">the <\/span>voting rate since it started?<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">\u201cEarlier in the parliament and assembly elections, the voting rate was 45-50%. But now we are observing that it is 60-65%. That is, the rate has increased by almost 15-20%. In my last tenure, I was in Narmada district and it is totally a tribal district. Even there the voting rate was around 86%. After all the initiatives taken by the Election Commission of India, several improvements have been there but they are not 100% or sufficient. Also<span lang=\"en-US\">,<\/span> <span lang=\"en-US\">the <\/span>Election Commission wants that it should be maximum in each and every place. Sometimes we observe that the total voting is around 45-50% and the winning candidate gets around 35% voting, so it is not fair for democracy.\u201d<\/p><p lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">3)<span lang=\"en-US\"> What is the vision of Election Commission of India as regards to the voter turnout?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">\u201cThe only vision of the Election Commission is 100% registration and 100% voting. No voters are to be left behind.\u201d<\/p><p lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">4)Apart from voting awareness what does EC<span lang=\"en-US\">, <\/span>I(Election Commission of India) do?<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">\u201cCurrently Election Commission of India is well focused on <span lang=\"en-US\">the <\/span>registration of voters. When an election process is ongoing at that time it provides 100%<span lang=\"en-US\"> security with CCTV camera at the counting centre. Election Commission of India\u2019s motto is to achieve a better voting strength and we are constantly working on that.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\"><span lang=\"en-US\">5)Apart from this what message would you like to convey to the students of DDU?<\/span><\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\">\u201c<span lang=\"en-US\">I appeal to the students of this university that as far as this camp(Electoral Literacy Club) is concerned, they should try to go for registration. After they should go for voting because we know that every single vote matters. Many times we observe that a candidate loses by one vote. Therefore voting is a must and before that registration is a must. Only if voting is gradually increased until we reach a higher rate, we will strengthen our democracy.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p lang=\"en-US\">\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-US\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Team DDU Connect is thankful to Shri I K Patel for spending his valuable time with us.<\/span><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shri I K Patel IAS is the current Collector of Kheda district.

Engineer in Jacob&#8217;s Engineering Private Limited. She has been with the firm since the past eight years. She completed her masters from the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. DDU connect got the precious opportunity to interview her. Here are some excerpts from the same.<\/p>\n<p><b>1. Will you please brief us about process engineering?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say it is the beginning of everything. Process comes prior to any kind of work in chemical, mechanical, instrumentation or civil plant. It is impossible for others to start their work before process engineering. It is one of the areas where a chemical engineer can focus on. A chemical engineer doesn\u2019t only have to work in plants by operating or running it. They can even contribute to the designing part through process engineering field. They can design the refineries and chemical plants among others.<\/p>\n<p><b>2. Apart from your job, what are you or used to be more passionate about?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I have been extremely passionate about music since a young age but I never got the chance of learning it. Other than that, I always try to inspire others to fulfil their dreams since I was lucky enough to get support from someone. So, I repay that kindness by helping others through financial aid, moral support or through teaching.<\/p>\n<p><b>3. What is your definition for success, and who is your role model?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Success can be anything that gives you satisfaction. Money or your position does not define success. It doesn\u2019t mean anything until and unless you are truly satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>My mother is my role model. I lost my father at a young age. My mother did a commendable job in raising five daughters single-handedly, especially in those days.<\/p>\n<p><b>4. You have worked with Jacobs engineering for a long time, would you like to share your experience with us?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yes, sure. Shifting from a small firm to Jacobs was a refreshing experience. Jacobs opened many doors of success for me. It is an upward elevator for any deserving person at Jacobs. Here, your success is purely based on your performance. Your age, gender or experience cannot stop you. If you are deserving you can reach up to any level. Thankfully there isn&#8217;t any politics and I am very happy about that.<\/p>\n<p><b>5. You once said that any problem can be tackled with a huge amount of determination. Many of us lack that determination so could you give us any suggestion so that we can move towards our goal.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The golden key is that you must love what you do and should be firm about it. If you forcefully do something then you&#8217;ll never be able to achieve what you truly want. So always try to do something you love.<\/p>\n<p><b>6. Could you tell us the technical challenges you faced in being a process engineer?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Frankly speaking, I did not face any technical challenges. In my career, all my superiors and bosses were quite supportive. There is no gender discrimination in this industry. So, I never faced any problem where I could not go one step ahead. The only problem I faced was during my education since my financial conditions weren&#8217;t good. I wanted to pursue my career in the medical field. Those were the only days I faced problems. Other than that, I have met great people. And I wish that in this position I can also reciprocate the same to my subordinates so they don&#8217;t face any difficulties in climbing up the corporate ladder.<\/p>\n<p><b>7. Can you tell us the male to female ratio in Jacob&#8217;s engineering?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><br>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are around 12-13% females. I know it is quite less and we are trying to recruit more female employees. The only problem is the female students are not fully aware of the opportunities available in the industry. Hence, we are planning to give lectures to students who are taking new admission in colleges to tell them about the available opportunities. For example, in mechanical engineering, everyone assumes it\u2019s a man\u2019s job. But that is not true. There are many opportunities available inside the office like piping design, piping engineering and many more. Many people are still not aware of it. Thus, we are trying to approach students who have just passed 12th to let them know about these opportunities. Like in mechanical engineering we don&#8217;t get any CVs from females. These days everyone wants to pursue IT.<\/p>\n<p><b>8. Do you have any suggestions for the upcoming engineers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I would say that during the first five years of your career don\u2019t think a lot about your salary and don&#8217;t change jobs frequently. In fact, for the first ten years you should focus on learning new things. So, try to be at one place for five years and then the world is open for you.<\/p>\n<p><b>9.What message would you like to convey to our readers?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I would like to ask them to study and make their fundamentals strong. If that is strong then no one will stop you. Currently, I feel this generation gets everything easily. You get education and jobs easily so you don&#8217;t understand its importance. Be strong in your fundamentals and keep the right attitude.<\/p>\n<p>DDU connect is extremely grateful to Kunjal Vaidya for spending her valuable time with us.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kunjal Vaidya is a Senior Process Engineer in Jacob&#8217;s Engineering Private Limited.

Sir, you are one of the prominent and influential researchers in the field of pollution control, so what inspired you to take up the challenge and how was your journey so far?<\/b><br \/>When I was a graduate student, I was working on polymers and found that polymer degradation was the greatest challenge. I used to read about the challenges of degradation, the release of toxic pollutants from polymers in newspapers and journals. When I understood the gravity of the problem, I decided to work on solving these challenges. My next step was to join Dharmsinh Desai University where I started working on projects related to polymer and environmental pollution at Shah-Schulman Centre for Surface Science and Nanotechnology (SSCSSN). As for the journey, it was quite difficult since there are many unknowns in research-related projects. Also, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure you&#8217;ve to handle. But, if your goal is clear then anything is possible. My goal and vision was clear from the day I started working at the University. I was inspired by Narendra Modi and Barack Obama as they were among the few powerful people who felt the need to address environmental issues and climate change caused by pollution. I felt it was my duty as a scientist and engineer to contribute my knowledge for solving the challenges.<\/p><p><b>2.) Sir, could you give us the highlights of the International Environment Forum to discuss the transfer of technology for Water Sustainability in Tapie city?<\/b><br \/>Since Tapie is an island, it is typhoon prone and witnesses several typhoons and cyclones in a year. After the cyclone or typhoon, the water turbidity level increases drastically. Since a developed country cannot afford to shut down the plants, they need to filter out these impurities. Polymer membranes and processes which are needed to filter the water are responsible for generating a lot of pollutants and thus cause several issues. To solve this, we provided them with a modified polymer material to control the amount of pollution. We also gave them several ideas to bring down the water turbidity level within 6-7 hours so the water will at least be drinkable. This was also a part of the circular economy concept.<\/p><p><b>3.) Sir, could you tell us in brief about your research due to which you were awarded the Young Scientist Award by the Society of Polymer, Japan?<\/b><br \/>I was given the objective to control the release of Carbon-dioxide(CO2) by my professor. Generally, everyone directs their research towards storing CO2. But I wanted to go beyond. So I went on to study how a leaf works and read several other researches and journals. I understood that the key area of problem was the release of electrons. Conversion of Co2 takes place only if the electrons are released. Rest of the methods could be performed and were quite possible. To develop the electron transfer mechanism we need to synthesise a film which can perform as an artificial leaf. My first step was to review all the previous articles and research. To succeed in any research, we must know all the previously established research and facts. We encountered several failures and over the months of research and finally, we found that dendrimer ppt was the most suitable. Further developing the research we created our first assembly of artificial leaf. This was the first report around the world where CO2 from the air could be converted to solar fuel.<\/p><p><b>4.) How was your experience working in the Nanotechnology Centre of our University?<\/b><br \/>I believe that small steps are very important for a vision to be successful. After completing my masters I wanted to go for research and so I left my position at the Asian Paints and came here. At that time, Dr Dinesh O. Shah and Dr P.A Joshi guided and inspired me. He liked my ideas and wanted someone who can implement projects as infrastructure was already available. I started by working on a small project which later proved to make a huge difference in the industry. I worked consistently for 6-7 months to develop a product and at the end of the year, we developed 9 commercial products which are already commercialised and made a significant difference to prevent environmental pollution and polymer composite. I learned a lot about the surface phenomenon here. When I was about to leave Dr Atindra Shukla was the incharge director and I learned a great deal about the scientific approach and analytical techniques from him. I used these techniques in my later research as well. I am very thankful to the wonderful professors who taught me a great deal and provided me with this excellent platform.<\/p><p><b>5.) Sir, India is one of the most polluted countries in the world. The air pollution levels in cities like Delhi and Mumbai are deadly. What concrete steps would you suggest to tackle this problem?<\/b><br \/>India is not the only polluted country. According to the pollution reports of the year 2016-17, you will find that Beijing and Shanghai were the most polluted cities. But what happened then? You&#8217;ll see that in the year 2018-19 their levels of pollution decreased consistently. Why? It was because of the government legislation policy. The government of China studied the failure stories of pollution control from various countries. The data is collected by the UN and its sub-organisations who also partake in green chemistry and provide direction in which a government must head to control pollution. Thus, legislation is very important. We should have some strict regulations by pollution control boards such as GPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board), who have already started working on this. Although, the most important thing is the implementation of the policy. The list of policies and rules doesn&#8217;t matter unless a strict and efficient implementation is carried out. The present Government is taking concrete steps to make this possible but it will be difficult since India is such a large country with a huge population. We need to be patient and in the meantime educate others as well as ourselves about pollution control. We also need to be conscious of the pollution we do on an individual basis. As responsible citizens, we should follow laws pertaining to pollution control diligently. Thus, it&#8217;s quite possible to even remove our name from the list of the most polluted countries.<\/p><p><b>6.) Sir, what message would you like to give to the students of our University?<\/b><br \/>See, we always want to be like someone else. When someone is inspired by me, they want to become like me. I also wanted to be as good as Dr D.O Shah and Dr Atindra Shukla. But the thing is that we need to give our everything and work with utmost dedication to achieve our goals. There are no shortcuts to success. You need to keep working and be focused even at the time of failure. Our goals should also be very clear and we should know where we want to see ourselves in the next five years. Nothing is possible without any dedication and with dedication, nothing is impossible.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.)

between inspiration and motivation, so how do you define them?<\/b><br \/>I always say that I\u2019m not a motivational speaker rather an inspirational speaker. I think motivation is something which can be compared to a balloon. Just a needle is enough to pop a fully inflated balloon, but on the other hand, inspiration is something which stays with us forever. Inspiration is self-motivation. Anyone can motivate you but only a few selected can inspire you.<\/p><p><b>2. How has your journey been from a corporate trainer to multinational corporate houses?<\/b><br \/>It has been amazing but at the same time, initially ,it was a huge challenge for me. When you are in your teenage years and you have to handle say four thousand people, the basic question which crosses everyone\u2019s mind is \u2018what this kiddo can motivate us\u2019. But I have always welcomed such criticism. When your intentions are clear and pure, nothing can stop you from achieving what you want. It makes you a good human being which makes you connected with good people and when you are connected with good minds, you\u2019ll get that you are in this field for satisfaction and not for greed<\/p><p><b>3. What obstacles did you face before becoming the youngest motivational speaker of India?<\/b><br \/>According to me, the obstacles which we face are not from outside instead from our inner selves. Deprival of family support makes you feel that you are the lone warrior in your battle. Initially I had to work hard on my stammering issues. Second was to keep myself updated with knowledge. I always try to deliver something new every time I face the crowd and I guess that\u2019s what differentiate me from other motivational speakers. Your speaking skills also play a major role. If you compare my confidence, content level, body language of today to that of three years ago when I came in DDU, you\u2019ll see a vast difference. I was kind of a boring speaker at first. I have seen people sleeping, using phones etc. when I deliver. But due to experience, I have learned so many things and now you can see where I am. The main thing is that wherever you reach in your life never forget your roots and that will make you grounded.<\/p><p><b>4. Do you like your hectic schedule, like preparing for dynamic contents every now and then and maintaining your time table?<\/b><br \/>I just got married this January and I have not gone out with my wife even once. The sole reason behind it is my busy schedule. But the best part is I\u2019m loving what I do. I usually consider Monday as a me day, where I usually don\u2019t give my dates but see here I\u2019m today delivering my speech on a Monday. Whenever it comes to military people or students I never give excuses not to attend them. Always do what you love. Don\u2019t force yourself to love what you do. If you don\u2019t love what you do, even if you\u2019ll get six Sundays in a week you\u2019ll find it unsatisfying.<\/p><p><b>5. What is your source of motivation?<\/b><br \/>My source of motivation is Music. Music is something which keeps me going. Whenever I feel low, I listen to my playlists and I feel really great after it. Always look for your source of motivation in something which is permanently yours, not something which is temporary.<\/p><p><b>6. You were an electrical engineer before becoming an inspirational speaker, so did it ever strike you that you could have done something better than the four years of engineering?<\/b><br \/>Yes, definitely I feel so.I had scored 92% in tenth and everyone was like you have scored very good marks and you are meant to be an engineer.It was my father\u2019s friend who suggested me to do electrical engineering. Moreover he himself was an electrical engineer and I was not mature enough to ask him what he had accomplished in his life. My manners were stopping me to ask him this question .Then I went to college and realised that I am not meant to an engineer.Though I scored good marks and was a university topper but scoring marks is no big deal as you just have to mug up the content. I had started doing business along with my studies. I used to attend college during the day and then at evening I used to do the business giving myself three to four hours of sleep everyday.I used to manage both studies and business simultaneously. Istudied for my parents and did business for myself. After I completed my graduation I said to my father that I have not interest in doing engineering any further and told him that I want to do MBA. So have completed my MBA in marketing from ISBR Business School.<\/p><p><b>7. Even while doing things that we love to do, often we find ourselves gasping for breath and ready to give up. Has it ever happened to you?What keeps you going on a long day, especially when there is a crowd to attend to.<\/b><br \/>Many times it happened in initial sessions. I will tell you a very interesting story. At our time ragging was very popular or say it was trend. On 16th august 2009 I decided that on 16th august 2012 I will buy my own car. Somehow my seniors got this news and they invited me to their room. There were 24 of them surrounding me. They hey told me that I won\u2019t be able to buy a car. At that time I had learned a new concept of convertor so I filled my ears with convertor. The function of convertor was to convert negative energy into positive energy.They told me that I won\u2019t be able to do it. I heard I am the only one to do it. They told my car won\u2019t come. I heard my car will come. That day they did the ragging till four in the morning,. Till then ten out of them were asleep and till seven in the morning only the leader was the only person who was awake. He told me to confess that I won\u2019t be able to do it, but I was firm on my decision. Everyday when I went to the college , I used to see them standing on the gate and laughing at me. But this was the motivation for me and in fourth year seventh semester on 4th January 2012 I entered the campus with my car. I had completed my target eight months prior.Now see this was the self motivation for me. And from this experience I developed my own program \u2018Prove them wrong \u2018 , that is take the positive energy from the negative people. We face these kind of people at every stage of our life who keep on demotivating us but all we have to do is maintain a positive approach and prove them wrong. Also our friends play a major part in motivating us. I always keep those friends who are smarter than me, who can teach me something new and can do something productive with me.<\/p><p><b>8. What endearing quality about the students of DDU do you find that makes you keep coming back ?<\/b><br \/>Respect, it is respect which keeps me tied to the students. Also when I came back from Bangalore I was asked to train the students of DDU for recruitments. It was my first big project and the results were great. Whenever I come to this campus I get respect always. Also not every relationship is about love, it\u2019s about respect. Secondly the faculties are really great here I like interacting with them as well. I get positive vibes from this place and this is what attracts me the most.<\/p><p><b>9. Often I find myself listening to motivational speeches and TED talks but at the end of the day, I fail to implement on the principles due to sheer lack of will power. What would you like to say to people like me ?<\/b><br \/>Well I don\u2019t think it\u2019s lack of willpower, it\u2019s lack of vision. It\u2019s just because of not having proper goals and not able to see clearly the things in our life. We face the problems in our life as a challenge when there is a vision. When our goals are clear then there won\u2019t be any distractions in our life. Also if you don\u2019t know what is your goal then start exploring it. If haven\u2019t jumped in the swimming pool then you won\u2019t be able to learn swimming. So just dive into the pool and explore and try finding your goal but keep trying it.<\/p><p><b>10. What message would you like to convey to our readers ?<\/b><br \/>Keep reading, keep laughing. Also how much you read doesn\u2019t matter but how much you implement it in your life is what matters the most. I don\u2019t read much in year but I do make sure that I implement those things and it\u2019s a fact that action without implementation won\u2019t work.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.Youngsters are quite baffled between inspiration and motivation, so how do you define them?I always say that I\u2019m not a motivational speaker rather an inspirational speaker.

She is the disciple of Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty, founder of the music institution, Shrutinandan.&nbsp; She performs Hindustani classical, semi-classical, devotional, commercial Bengali and Hindi songs as a vocalist. She won the third position in Pashimbanga Rajya Sangeet Academy music competition in Raga Khayal and bagged the first position for Aalap. Presently she is working as a research scholar for a doctorate in Music under University of Calcutta. Team DDU Connect got an opportunity to interview her. Here are the excerpts from the same.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. What inspired you to take music as a profession?<\/strong><br \/>\n<i>&#8220;I belong to a musical family. My grandfather used to sing. My mother loved music but didn&#8217;t pursue it as career. My father used to teach music to children at home. So, the surrounding played an important role during my childhood. As a child, I used to sit in my father&#8217;s music class and used to sing. From there my father found a potential in me and started looking for a guru. I started learning from my aunts.&nbsp; Knowingly or unknowingly I was getting inclined towards music but it was kind of confusing for me. I couldn&#8217;t figure what was going on. I couldn&#8217;t decide whether I should pursue music as a career or not. At that time, my guruji insisted to pursue music as career. He persuaded me that I can do this. It was a gradual process but due to all these incidents, I chose music as my career.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. How was your experience of learning from Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>&#8221; My guru, Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, is like an ocean. He is very affectionate and very caring. When I was not sure about music, he inspired me. He encouraged me a lot. I have no words for him. He was always supportive. He is the source of hope, strength and light in the darkness. Only the person who learns from him can understand this. &#8220;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Who is your role model?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>&#8221; Kuashiki Chakraborty is my role model. When I was a child, I used to listen to her. I was very much influenced by her. She sings that is why I want to sing. &#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Nowadays, we&#8217;re seeing a lot of old songs that are remade to suit the party lifestyle. What are your opinions on that?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>&#8221; One thing that we look for in music is aesthetic pleasure and it is very subjective. If you like this color, then it&#8217;s not necessary that everybody will like it. It is not defined in any constitution that everybody has to like it. Some people do not like it because music is totally influenced by psychology. How we are born and brought up, what phase we&#8217;re passing through currently, all these things affect the mental stability; and mental stability of mind is very necessary to appreciate good music. So, behind our likes and dislikes, our lifestyle influences a choice. That&#8217;s why I tell you to start listening to classical music. I just do not want to mark it as good music because I&#8217;m not the one to tell you what is good or right. First taste every dish, and then you choose one. &#8220;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. What are the struggles that an Indian Classical Singer faces?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>&#8221; There are many struggles. There is often no guarantee that you&#8217;ll get enough wage. I knew it at the time of choosing this path and that&#8217;s why I was mentally prepared. I don&#8217;t have any family member that belongs to the music industry <\/em><em>s<\/em><em>o I didn&#8217;t even know whether it&#8217;ll work or not. I started my path, I jumped into the industry and it was a totally different experience. Singing and learning is something, but walking in the industry, working, is a completely other thing. There are some issues that still exists. We don&#8217;t get sponsorships for classical music. We&#8217;ve gotten support from many places like Gujarat and Odissa but from not all the places. So, it&#8217;s hard and I had other options but I keep reminding myself that I chose this as I love it. &#8220;<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. What message would you like to convey to our readers?<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>&#8221; As I&#8217;m a classical singer and was brought up with classical music, so I&#8217;m obviously biased towards it. Even so, I request you everyone to listen to classical music regardless of not understanding it. I believe that everyone will definitely like it if they just start listening to it. Perhaps every day is not possible, but make a habit of listening to it at least twice a month. And when the habit will be hardwired, they&#8217;ll understand about the aesthetic sense within oneself. This is our heritage and we should support<\/em> it. &#8220;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Team DDU Connect is grateful to Ms. Manali Ghosh for sparing her valuable time with us and sharing her experiences.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ms. Manali Ghosh, daughter of Sri Joydeb Ghosh, is an Indian Classical Singer.

manager of Huntsman Pvt. Ltd, what does your average day consists of?<br \/>Ans: Normally, an average day is of 12hrs. I start at 8 in morning and finish at 8 in evening. It depends. Being in an MNC, timings are not fixed. Sometimes we start too early in morning and sometimes it extends late.<\/p><p>2) Sir, can you tell us about the major change in technologies that you have witnessed in Chemical Industry during the entire span of your <b>career?<\/b><br \/>Ans: Fundamentals are not changing. But the applications are changing. If I take the example of my earlier days, we were using conventional technologies for filtration. But now, we have automated filters which work on the same principle.<\/p><p>3) Chemical Industry and Environmental adversity are associative terms. But the recent action of Huntsman Industry to help the people of Luna Village in solving their water scarcity issue is a great initiative. How was your company inspired to undertake this initiative?<br \/>Ans.: We conducted a survey via an external agency in Luna and Umrah villages. It was found that groundwater in the whole Padra region was contaminated. So Huntsman took the initiative to clean the groundwater. We extracted 1100 m3 of contaminated water which was then cleaned, sent to the ATP and then to the channel. Slowly and steadily the groundwater profile is improving.<br \/>A reverse osmosis plant was set up in the village of Umrah to provide drinking water to the community. In Luna village, a 500-kilo litre tank was constructed. With support from Gujarat water association board, water was taken from the Narmada canal and distributed from a tank there.<\/p><p>4) Innovation and research are signs of continuous growth. How do you cope up with the extremely competitive marketplace and ensure a balance between demands and sources?<br \/>Ans: It is a very broad question. The Textile industry is going through a big turmoil in terms of environmental footprint. We introduced withera series product. It produces rich colour but the water requirement is thirty per cent less and energy requirement is twenty per cent less than before.<\/p><p>5) Sir, can you tell us about some of your experiences while working for huntsman private limited?<br \/>Ans. I passed out from this university and Dr Joshi was one of my Gurus. After completing my 12th, I was determined to become a chemical engineer from DDIT. I always like to take new challenges; try new things. So that is how my career grew. I have joined many corporations. I am now working with Huntsman for almost six years. I think it\u2019s a very encouraging experience and I always believe that if you do your job with full honesty and do not forget your values, then nothing can beat you.<\/p><p>6) What are the qualities the chemical industries are looking for while recruiting freshers?<br \/>Ans: To the new graduates, I would like to say that do not worry about challenges. There will be many challenges but you have to put your best efforts. I did the same thing for 26 years. The learning attitude needs to be there all the time.<\/p><p>7) There is a rising trend in industries to adopt practices of sustainable disruption along with sustainable development. What do you think about its feasibility in India?<br \/>Ans: It is very much feasible and we have to make it feasible. Sustainability is one of the major concerns of our corporation. Three years back, we had four spray driers in operation. We once had a complaint from a farmer about discolouration in crop leaves due to colour pigments emitted from them. The emission level of our spray drier stack which was 8 ppm and the limit was 100 ppm. Since we were far below the allowable limit, our case could be defended. But it was a question of his livelihood. So we installed four new non-steam scrubbers to eliminate the 8 ppm of pollutant level. And there are no complaints now.<\/p><p>8) Sir, what message would you like to give to DDU students?<br \/>Ans: See, wherever I go, I have the responsibility of the global role of managing process safety and engineering in the world. And whenever I start any presentation, I start with my value system- Honesty, Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. So I advise all students that whatever you do, think about these values and any additional values you believe in. The rest will follow.<\/p><p>9) What is your success mantra?<br \/>Ans: My mantra is- just do your work; success will automatically follow. In my 26 years of career, I never asked for a salary raise. You just do your job. I interview many young engineering graduates. One of them frequently changed his job. I interviewed him and asked, \u201cWhy do you want to join our organisation?\u201d He replied along the lines of learning new things and all. So I assured him about receiving best mentoring. But his aim was salary hike so he did not join. So I would advise to build your career and make yourself industry worthy in the beginning. Then fly as you wish.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1) Sir, as the global engineering manager of Huntsman Pvt.

Here are the excerpts from the same.<\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><b>1. Ma\u2019am, you were born and brought up in a family of artists. Naturally, you were influenced by your supremely talented parents and grandparents. So do you remember any triggering moment that attracted you towards the music?<\/b><br><i>\u201cThere was no specific moment which I distinctly remember. But music was always in the air. I used to listen when my father rehearsed. On normal days, he used to teach me Bandish. Ever since my childhood, I was in love with music. There was no spark or that &#8220;Eureka&#8221; moment. It happened naturally, I got attracted to music because I liked music.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>2. You gave your first performance at a very tender age. You were just nine when you performed. So how was your experience at such a tender age performing before audience?<\/b><br><i>\u201cMy knees were shaking out of nervousness. I had never spoken on mic before in my life. So I didn&#8217;t know how my voice would be as I was singing in front of it. There was a huge audience waiting for our performance. It was a three days festival named \u201cShriman Shankar Pandit Prasang&#8221;. Though the performance went well, I was terrified at that moment. I was tensed as my grandfather was also present there. At the end, the performance went well and that was kind of a relief. \u201c<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>3. What does your average day consists of? Do you ever feel stressed by doing a number of performances?<\/b><br><i>\u201cWhile I\u2019m not travelling, my day starts around 8 am. There are some ineluctable administrative work; a bit of teaching music and attend few music programmes. Nevertheless, music is always a part of my life. I never feel stressed doing a number of performances.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Among all the different genres that you pursue, which one would you count as your favourite and why?<\/b><br><i>\u201cKhyaal is one of my favourite. Certainly there is no special reason behind it.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Last year, we got a chance to see Ustad Sabir Khan and Tabla maestro HeikoDjiker\u2019s performance. You too have collaborated with him for some work in the past. Ma\u2019am, can you please tell us about your experience?<\/b><br><i>\u201cThey have dedicated their life for music. It was a good experience to have worked with them for many years.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>6. Earlier there used to be musical programmes and mahostavas, which have considerably reduced to very few platforms like Spic Macay. What are your opinions about the inclination of the present generation towards Indian classical music?<\/b><br><i>\u201cNowadays the musical programmes have restricted themselves to metropolitan cities and have evolved into an embellished form. However, social media has changed the scenario. By making better use of the technology, it has become very easy for a music aspirant to know about me and my work. When it comes to take classical music to the next generation, I conduct music classes for music aspirants and they are good singers. For that very reason I\u2019m actually in hurry to reach home to impart knowledge to them. There is undoubtedly a difference when music is taught at school and when it\u2019s taught at home.\u201d<\/i><\/p><i>\n<\/i><p><b>7. What is your success mantra and what message would you like to give to the students of our University?<\/b><br><i>\u201cEvery individual must just follow his dreams. Where everything changes with time, it is only your dreams that sustain and make you complete and self-contented. If you choose to listen to the world, the happiness and satisfaction gets converted to boredom; and I have personally seen it. For a certain period of time, people feel self-contented in earning wealth; however the clouds of boredom that emerge, engulf all the satisfaction of life.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p>DDU Connect is extremely grateful to Dr.Meeta Pandit for spending her valuable time with us.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr.MeetaPandit Dr.MeetaPandit is a Hindustani Classical vocalist belonging to the Gwalior Gharana.

Joshi is currently working as a Senior Environment Specialist with the World Bank Group. As a Senior Environment Specialist at the World Bank, he ensures that all the projects funded by the World Bank lead to a positive effect on the environment. He has been working in the Field of Environment Conservation for almost 19 years and has reached this formidable position as a result. He completed his Bachelors from Dharmsinh Desai University and Masters from Birla Vishwakarma Mahavidyalaya and then went on to pursue an MSc in Environmental Technology from the Imperial College, London. Team DDU Connect got this edifying opportunity of interacting with him. Below are the excerpts of the same-<\/p><p><strong>Q1. Sir, what motivated you in doing MSc in Environmental Technology after completing bachelor&#8217;s as well as master&#8217;s in Civil Engineering?<\/strong><\/p><p>After a stint in consulting company, who sponsored my first Masters&#8217; Degree, I was working in the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Surat where I thought my skills were not being optimally utilized. To move to another organization from a secure government backed position was a tough call. This was until I saw a newspaper advertisement announcing application to the Shell Centenary Scholarship Programme supporting studies at selected universities in the UK and Netherlands. I applied there, thinking it will allow me a break and help me think through my priorities.<\/p><p><strong>Q2. As a Senior Environment Specialist at World Bank Group, how do you help the world in environment conservation?<\/strong><\/p><p>At World Bank (WB), environmental management is the key skill for managing risks. Projects financed by WB necessarily require an assessment and management of the environmental risks, including conservation if essential. A classical hierarchy of avoidance, minimisation, mitigation and compensation for negative impacts and enhancement of positive impacts wherever possible is the bedrock of our Operational policy on Environmental Assessment and will be of all our future policies as well.<\/p><p><strong>Q3. Where do you think, India stands on an environmental stand point of view? Some of our cities are among the most polluted cities in the world, so what can we do to control the situation in such cities?<\/strong><\/p><p>On a bigger picture India is an environmentally stressed country. With only 2.4% of the total land area, we support over 17.5% of the total population. At the same time, we have also been reasonably successful in living with nature over the millennia. This is changing, both due to the increased urban living and integration of India into the world at a faster rate than before. One thing to remember is that one-size-fits-all policy does not always work, especially in a country as diverse as ours. However, the common agenda to pursue includes increasing amount of sustainable energy sources and improving facilities for shared solutions rather than individual consumption. On a more specific level, limiting wastage, processing wastes and incorporating it in our strategy will also help. In addition to technical fixes, cities also need authority to act. But, this is a lot of work and to get it right is a trial and error method only.<\/p><p><strong>Q4. What steps should people follow to conserve environment and work upon the damage that has been done till now?<\/strong><\/p><p>Several things. You could start from making sure that what you do is environmentally responsible because it takes a lot to know what environment is. List of things that can be done include brushing your teeth with less water to sleeping in a non-AC room. These are personal choices. Then, there are institutional choices that we need to make on whether we should have enough electricity in the system from renewable sources or whether we should use sustainable harvested food and whether or not we need to have a higher population growth rate. From an Indian perspective, I think we haven\u2019t fared too badly, thanks to being secure being south of the Himalayas. In other places, life has been more difficult and therefore a particular set of resources has been used up faster than it has been able to regrow. On the whole, if you take or do not take steps, which you believe in your immediate environment will reduce footprints, is what matters.<\/p><p><b>Q5. Sir, can you tell us about some of your experiences while working for the World Bank Group?<\/b><\/p><p>It is an extremely fulfilling job. It has taken me to almost all states in the country. I have had opportunities to work on development in several other countries as well. It has improved my skills and made me appreciate the gift of living in a thriving democracy. My most notable experience was in Ethiopia where I learnt how knowledge trumps power, something we never see in India. We were discussing about road construction related impacts in the middle of a highway close to Jimma; and a junior officer of the Roads Agency contradicted his superior\u2019s opinion and stood his ground. The senior also acknowledged that he was right and decided to take action as per the junior&#8217;s perspective. An unthinkable situation in hierarchial system which we have inherited from the British. It is also a perilous job with high levels of satisfaction, if that is what drives one&#8217;s efforts.<\/p><p><b>Q6. The World Bank Group is aimed at eradicating extreme poverty by the year 2030. How do you work towards such a huge task? What is your approach?<\/b><\/p><p>Eradicating poverty is a huge task. The entire World Bank Group is looking to support governments around the world to achieve this goal. We provide concessional finance, knowledge and technical assistance as requested by the governments; so that their programmes geared towards poverty reduction are more effective. Our second goal is to boost shared prosperity. Our approach is to achieve this sustainably so that once achieved, there is no reversal of the trend. It is daunting to be able to integrate sustainability into such a wide agenda, and that is one more thing which makes my job exciting and fulfilling.<\/p><p>Q7. Sir, do you believe that the younger generations would prove to be progressionists in terms of environment conservation?<\/p><p>I believe man is part of environment. We should not be too concerned about what the present or the next generation will do. Each generation will find its own bearing. Generally speaking, if you look at mankind, with an approximate of 7 billion dead and 7 billion still coming, it is a very small percentage that we are talking. Environmentally, the younger generation is more conscious because now a lot of information flows across people faster. Something that we all need to work upon is trying to trust each other. Believing me when I say that air is polluted and taking measures to make sure that air preserved should not be doubted at all times. But, it will happen over time.<\/p><p>Q8. What message would you like to convey to our readers?<\/p><p>Find a job that you love and you will never have to work for earning. You will earn from pleasure. When your convictions are challenged, remember to stand up for those that matter. Also at the same time, be open minded. Biases are our biggest enemies. Education is a great liberator, let it not chain you to ideas handed to you but challenge yourself to develop your own thinking.<\/p><p>Team DDU Connect is grateful to Mr. Gaurav for giving such a great insight and also for his valuable time.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mr. Gaurav D.
