Take this and try it on and see if it fits you.\u201d My mom gestured holding up a pair of jeans in one hand, that vaguely resembled bell bottoms while making space for me to sit amidst piles of other such clothes that were probably seeking dust in her wardrobe since god knows when. I tried it on and to my surprise it fit so perfectly that I might have presumably been looking like she did when she must have worn it in her teens. It is said that old is gold. I preferably like to call it the opposite instead- old is priceless. Wearing mom\u2019s skirts and sarees, switching between dad\u2019s denim jackets and listening to retro songs of Jagjit Singh and Kishore Kumar on Sunday mornings, we all grew up. There\u2019s a song by \u2018The Trews\u2019 that proclaims that in the modern age, vintage love is the only true love. Vintage is indeed so peculiar to itself that the emotion and nostalgia associated with it is at an entirely different level.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t remember how exactly we ended up with the vintage fad instead of loving the essence that the 21st century holds. Perhaps it was when the smell of the age old books that your granddad gave you long ago, that took you with it in its arms into the story world or when you began collecting the obsolete yet antique coins of your great great grandparents\u2019 times. There is but nothing as timeless as the black and white; now turned yellow photographs of our forebears, our veterans and the historical times. None of us apparently during our childhood liked watching the reel movies and songs that were played on Doordarshan that our parents made us watch. Frustrated, we would ask them to change it so we could watch something that our eyes felt good watching. Ironically, now we call them \u2018the classics\u2019. They are black and white, yet full of all colors of life that they portray so gracefully.<\/p>\n<p>I might in fact have been so influenced with the vogue that now hung posters of Elvis Presley, the Cranberries and Bob Marley songs all across my wardrobe. There is love, vanity, simplicity and history in vintage. Vintage is the memento that we carry with us to be reminded of all the good and bad times and peoples the world has ever seen. This love of vintage is endless and is going to be relished forever. They say, \u201cOlder the fiddle, finer the tune\u201d. If truth be told, exploring vintage is as overwhelming as the feeling one gets while flipping through pictures of their toddlerhood. Time goes by fast. We will soon become vintage relics for our posterity. Before that happens relive the past. I call myself a 90s kid.

family. Especially in India, the closeness and attachments we have for our family are very strong. It becomes twice as much when we grow up in a joint family. You must be wondering what it&#8217;s like to be in a joint family. Well ahoy! Come on down to the clown town!<\/p><p>My family for once, is like a circus. Every circus is defined by its ringmaster. Well in our case, the ringmaster is my grandfather. Talking to him always feels like walking on a thin rope. My grandmother being a juggler, having upper hand over everything and managing it without failure. But at the same time, she&#8217;s a doll from the doll house. My dad is like an acrobat. Never settling, one who always has to run errands and also provide for the family with the performance. My uncle here, can be any of those huge cute animals, like a bear. He&#8217;s always there to entertain, play with or even give free hugs! My mother and aunt being the safety net, always there to take my fall. My siblings are the dwarfs from the circus, as annoying as quacking ducks and extremely frenzy like monkeys. And how can I forget the giant elephant who&#8217;s most loved and is known for eating for eternity and eternity? It&#8217;s me ladies and gentlemen. I&#8217;m Apu for you.<\/p><p>Every circus is known for a performance which thrills the performers as well as the viewers. The most exciting thing about my family is dinner. It normally starts with us sitting at the table waiting for food, me arguing with my brother about table space and how he shouldn&#8217;t rest his hand in my territory, in the lowest voice possible because god forbid, if my dada comes to know, one of us is probably gonna end up eating in the backyard. My father &#8220;loosens&#8221; his belt to make space in the tummy, enough to let ten African kids starve. The dining table is silent for a while but actually it&#8217;s the silence before the thunder, until a family member presents opinions about the news of the previous day. Now I&#8217;m quite sure after this the neighbours probably think we&#8217;re having a contention, a huge family drama. But it&#8217;s quite literally on what to cook for lunch the next day. Then we talk about how we spent the day and at last me trying to forcibly gulp the eggplant down. Sigh!<\/p><p>If you live in a joint family, you&#8217;re always familiar with the cries of stubborn cousins and hollers of aged uncles, gossips of the girl gang and cricket matches of the dad club. There will be family members of different nature and temperament in one house. You are taught the invaluable lesson of sharing from an early age. As tiring and overly annoying it might seem, there are some little joys that you only experience when you grow up in a joint family. Like listening to the amazing stories your grandparents tell you isn&#8217;t a once in a while affair. There&#8217;s no end to the unparalleled moments with your cousins. Every family trip becomes a major larger-than-life event that turns into a celebration. When there&#8217;s a special occasion like a wedding or a festival, the entire home changes into a grand spectacle. And the biggest perk of all, there will never come a day when there&#8217;s absolutely no home cooked food.<\/p><p>If there ever comes a point when you need advice, you&#8217;ll get tons of insightful opinions. The phrase &#8220;all for one and one for all&#8221; is literally true and fitting in a joint family. At the end of the day, family is all you have and in a joint family, you get to cherish that fact every single day.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0283935 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0283935\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-dd8acd7 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"dd8acd7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bd05f48 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bd05f48\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Priya Rathod\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT 3rd SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s nothing greater than a family.

I came back to my place with dozens of insipid journals. I had no clue where I was going to keep these in my messy room.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of walking in the door and exhaling into relief, the calm I hoped for was met with even more stress as my eyes set upon the table which had a galore of things on it. Keeping the journals at a secured place in my room almost seemed impossible. I sat on my couch and looked around my room which made me realize that I had a plethora of things which I don\u2019t even use. My eyes met with the pile of magazines and novels which I had planned to read regularly a long while ago but never succeeded. A brown coloured stuffed teddy bear which had lost its eyes lied next to the stack of my Sherlock Holmes series. At that very moment, I realized something that even if the books are old and torn or even if my teddy has only its face left I won\u2019t ever throw it away. Creating space for journals seemed to have less priority then.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inner me knew that I couldn\u2019t bear to lose these things. I wonder if it is just me; or everyone has the same feeling when we are asked to give up on something we clung onto for a long time.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We all have that special dress in our closet which we wore to a wedding five years ago, which probably would not fit us again but still we keep it. That watch which has stopped ticking centuries ago, but still has a reserved place in our drawers. That box of crayons which only serves the purpose of bringing back old memories has created its own space in our cupboards. We all have those kind of things in a drawer overflowing with every other stuff we didn\u2019t even know exist. Things which don\u2019t have value but are our secret tenacious treasures.<br \/>Why exactly can\u2019t we give up on these things? Are they really a treasure or something that encaptures our useful space. After giving a brief thought to it, I concluded that maybe we hold onto things which gives us hope. Sentiments and procrastination can also be the other two parameters. I guess our desire to hold onto piles and piles of old mementos can often be blamed on nostalgia. Maybe because reminiscing about the past makes us feel good.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t what you own so don\u2019t let the things you own, own you.\u201d We all have heard these clich\u00e9s before. But are we even close to decluttering our treasures?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a179e2d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"a179e2d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-62c25e7 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"62c25e7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-aa03446 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"aa03446\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a long tedious day at college, I came back to my place with dozens of insipid journals.

joy.\u201d Those 3\u00bd minutes spent laughing hard every Sunday afternoon with my loved ones are a true manifestation of the quote above. It all happens when my seven-year-old brother brings us his potion, the elixir of euphoria, which he says is inspired from Harry Potter\u2019s elixir to induce euphoria but is heavier in dose than the original one as his potion causes hysteric laughter rather than excessive singing and nose-tweaking. It\u2019s a Sunday ritual now. He brings us his potion filled in glasses and sets them on the table set up in the backyard where we sit, stretch and relax. We never got to know or would ever get to know about his conspiracies behind making us drink it. We drink it anyway. My aunt cackles first, and then my mom goes all guffaws. I am sitting in my seat smirking at the craziness these people can portray and already thinking about the acts of lunacy about to come up. Until this time, my dad would be chortling and my uncle would have begun to howl. Watching them, I would lose it and go complete hysterics. All in all, we would be roaring with laughter, not because of the drink instead watching each other belly laugh as though we might just end up killing ourselves. The little guy stands there, grinning on the outside but seemingly perplexed on the inside pondering perhaps over the overacting we do. \u201cHow can adults be so stupid? It\u2019s just water.\u201d We all have the greatest of times whenever this young fellow joins in.<br \/>With a blown-up mind and in an utter state of euphoria, I asked the little guy on one such Sunday evening, though with no real intent of knowing the answer, rather to just strike a sweet, heart-warming conversation, \u201cHow is it that Harry Potter seemed to inspire you to forge this delightful elixir of yours?\u201d He said, \u201cYou guys. Watching every one of you laugh out loud, with all the power present within; it\u2019s refreshing, exciting and satisfying. As if we have escaped reality and travelled to some other dimension where it\u2019s only us, and I can only think of keeping all of you happy forever.\u201d Whether or not one such potion exists for real, I am not sure. What seemed lucid in that very moment was his unmistakable rectitude to find new ways to express his love for his family. For a love like this he never needed an elixir, neither do either of us.<br \/>What would inspire your elixir of euphoria?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-40be14e elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"40be14e\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-7c15f03 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"7c15f03\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a132b6c elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"a132b6c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Snigdha Lokre\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Snigdha Lokre<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cYour soul cannot heal without joy.\u201d Those 3\u00bd minutes spent laughing hard every Sunday afternoon with my loved ones are a true manifestation of the quote above.

very vital role in my development. With every chapter, the connection built with the characters of the book keeps on getting stronger and when the book has me completely drowned in it, the next thing I realize is that I have reached the last chapter. I know that the strings of connection, tightened with so many difficulties, are loosening but, I still want to read the last chapter so badly that I cannot resist and go on to finish it. A couple of pages and everything comes to an end, but what lasts with me forever are those invisible strings. Although the knots begin to loosen after a while, yet they are tightly tied to a corner of my mind and I try my best to hold onto them.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>One such congenial book, for me, is DDU Connect. Although I consider it as a book, it is very different than any other book. I have reached its last chapter, but every single cell of my brain and heart is prompting me to not read the last chapter. They simply aren\u2019t prepared for the end yet; although it is known that I am one of the co-authors of this chapter. If they could stop the sands of time, they definitely would have. Just like I can never resist reading the last chapter, I won\u2019t be able to elude this one too, only, this would not be my will. Knowing that this side of the wall is more pretty, I would want to stand on the other side of it, because I know that I will still have people with me who will make the other side as pretty as this one for me.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>A thousand pictures with the same people but, all telling a different tale of a different time. Our phones would surely have run out of memory if it wasn\u2019t for the Cloud providing unlimited storage. The pictures may not have been clicked at the perfect time, but they were all captured at times which were perfect. After a few years, when all of us would be away from each other, in different corners of the world, yet just a call way, these are going to be the pictures that we will all look at and have our eyes filled with tears of nostalgia. With tears swiftly rolling down our cheeks, our faces would have a wide smile remembering the silly reason for which we were smiling in the pictures.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>All I want is nothing more but to hear a knock at my door on a fine Saturday morning after a tiring week of work, only to find the characters from this book that we call CONNECT, when I open the door. I cannot fathom how the last chapter of that book would be! I don\u2019t know if I will be able to write it or not, but I am so sure that I definitely want to start it.

The sand is turning dark, the birds are returning from the horizon and the sun has already submerged halfway into the ocean. The scene is ever so clich\u00e9 but my heart strains to fathom all of this into a bunch of random words, hoping it would turn out to be something meaningful. At times like this, I go far enough to fancy myself as a writer.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I go showing my pieces to my friends, who are too nice to say anything but \u2018nice\u2019. They would say that I write good and it is something beyond them, that it is enough. This ought to invoke a dubious sense of self-worth, of satisfaction; and brassy satisfaction is a hindrance to bringing out the best. So, I get outside of my little bubble and read. I read the stories that have made people immortal, the poems that have made their way into everyone\u2019s heart and I wonder. I wonder if I can even write. And I fall into an intense discussion with myself that seems to go on for days, with no sign of conclusion in sight. I stop writing, and then, after some time I start it again. At the very least, I pick up the pen. After sitting quietly for hours, and letting my mind get clouded by the feeling of inferiority sired from reading the works of great art, finally the pen touches the paper and the result is only a mere dot. So I ask others, \u201cHow do you write so well?\u201d Some answer sincerely, some wittily, while some quote Peter De Vries, \u201cWrite drunk, edit sober.\u201d After trying all of their methods and realizing that nothing works on me, I sit and just write. I convince myself that I do not write for others but myself. So I don\u2019t have to be that good at it, let alone great.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I write because my heart is choked up with sentiments and ideas. I write because the touch of a pen sends shivers through my body and the white paper compels me to unleash the thoughts. One must understand that art underpins writing. To quote John Keating, \u201cWe do not read and write poetry because it is cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race.\u201d Words can heal and hurt, but writing is much more than just words. It is symphony and dance and gibberish and harmony. The commas and apostrophes speak just as much as words. It is where the fingers transpose and blend the spaces between eyes and pages, to extort the soul and sentience out of writings. That is where the magic happens. When I\u2019m out in the real world, looking at my magic, I believe I can write. Then I read and contravene myself. I write, anyway.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-24760ad elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"24760ad\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-da05878 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"da05878\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-833e146 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"833e146\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m sitting on a bench.

data-test=\"textbox\">After finishing a long battle with studies at school, my worn out soul was screaming for solace. I pedaled in search of familiarity and suddenly a tantalizing aroma hypnotised my limbs to move towards its source. My mom had prepared kidney beans curry with steamed rice as a reward for finally scoring ninety &#8211; six in mathematics. That was the day when I decided to try recreate some of the magic she does in the kitchen.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">There have been many trials and errors since that day. Steamed rice was first on my to &#8211; accomplish list as I hail from Southern part of India. But forgetting to pour water in the pressure cooker pan caused a blast bigger than those at Diwali. Since then, my mother has not allowed me to enter the kitchen without parental guidance. Gradually, I made progress from destroying the cookware to creating burnt brown residue. Some kind of twisted Midas touch might have possessed me as I could transform any dish into inedible mess.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">My mother could not see her workplace being wrecked by my determination to cook. So, she introduced me to the world of culinary arts. Cooking in many ways, I then discovered is a scientific process. First you need to make hypothetical assumptions what kind of textures and flavours would go together. Then comes verification with the help of existing theorems. Here, it includes pre tasting of raw materials to predict how they would suit the recipe. The next step involves measuring and experimenting. All ingredients get mixed in measured proportions and temperature variations are carried to obtain a balanced output. Finally we have the evaluation where mistakes made in various processes are found. This is found out by judging looks and taste. Results of this analysis are used to then correct the faults in assumptions. But it differs from other scientific processes as you can always add a bit of your imagination while experimenting.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">Cooking together as a team is a great bonding activity. All strengths are utilized and weaknesses covered together. Chopping, marinating, saut\u00e9, grilling , frying, baking and garnishing are then assigned accordingly. Coordination with each other is important as different processes consume different time intervals. At the end when all sit together to eat, some of the most cherished memories are made.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">When you cook something for your dear ones, extra ingredient are added to the dish like affection and care. When you cook their favourite dish, all you care about is the smile as they taste the food. . Unless you start living on your own, you don&#8217;t realize the difference this special ingredient makes. But not many are lucky to have at least one square meal. So if we could make a meal for the needy once in a while, won&#8217;t it be a step towards eradicating world hunger?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9a0dc86 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"9a0dc86\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-7281340 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"7281340\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-36f1925 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"36f1925\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SUNAINA-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunayana Samavedam\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sunayana Samavedam<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After finishing a long battle with studies at school, my worn out soul was screaming for solace.

I sat on the shore and watched the waves emerging from their mother, the sea and crashing into the mighty rocks. A sad circumstance that was seemingly real, had carved its place in my mind.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">The dawn was nearing at the time and due to strong winds, the waves seemed more daunting than ever. They charged at the rocks with warrior cries that could be heard miles away from the war. Their enemy, the land didn&#8217;t flinch seeing the waves coming towards him. He seemed to trust his defences. The rocks sure were old and weathered but their experience of the war was older than the life itself. They were there at the time when the war started. On the other hand, the waves were just children whose souls were filled with only fury and determination. They were born only a few seconds ago and will die, perhaps in a minute or so. It was as if their sole purpose of being born was to defeat their mother&#8217;s age old enemy. It was a disheartening sight, but then war always is. It was hard to contemplate how the sea bore the loss of her children. No one knew what mysterious forces and events had led to the starting of the war but the sea seemed obdurate to be the one to end it. She sent forth her children day and night for years to the frontier to attack the rocks until they finally break. For the children, death was a small sacrifice they were willing to pay for their mother&#8217;s resolve. It was a despairing realisation and I couldn&#8217;t help but have contempt for the sea.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">Someone else also seemed to share my discontent with the circumstances. The sun, who was known to be secretly in love with the sea, was a witness of the war. Just when he was about to hide beneath the sea, his pale orange eyes met mine. They were tired and reflected great sorrow into the sea. He certainly had a story to tell. In those brief moments, we had a conversation with our eyes. It broke his heart to see the children die for what he thought was a futile war. He was about to say his final goodbye when as if for the final time, he shone with hope. He seemed to share his hopes for the future of the children to me. When he was gone, I suddenly had this notion that he had been helping them escape the war all along. After all, those children can take different forms.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c3bd8a2 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"c3bd8a2\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-9f3c61d elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"9f3c61d\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-de06d00 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"de06d00\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-P-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was clear to me what it meant when I saw the elements of nature coming up against each other, an everlasting war.

aka holiday. My plan to sleep-in till noon had to be disbanded when I got a call from work to show up at the workplace immediately. I was hoping for a crazy stream of mad colleagues running here and there to get everything done as soon as possible. Only, the scene was quite unusual and unsettling. Their faces were covered in poster colours, and their mood seemed to be in a merry state despite being called on a holiday. Their hands were full of paintbrushes and crayons. It seemed like they were enjoying every moment while creating posters and banners- as was the assigned task. It was strange because it was very different from our workline and yet, everyone was loving it. I still wasn\u2019t able to find the reason behind such behaviour of theirs. Before I could know, I had been given a similar task and was stroking a brush dipped in blue colour down the poster. Soon, I too was covered in different colours. The intoxicatingly acrid smell slowly coating me sent me on a trip down memory lane.<\/p><p>The stroll down the memory lane was quite nostalgic. For it brought the sweet memories I made during my childhood with those crayons and oil pastels, back to the conscious part of my brain. I was gradually getting soaked in the rainstorm of my very own memories, till an ironic sun called \u2018life\u2019 broke the storm. It was like being thrown in a world I had for long, forgotten had existed; all this while executing the allocated task. All these overwhelming feelings were mutual, and the reason as to why everyone had a smile on their faces despite the colour stains on their expensive shirts, eventually became clear to me.<\/p><p>From childhood to geezerhood, life is but a collection of electromagnetic radiation over a visible region with each beam of certain energy representing a different shade of life. Those colours are there with us in every moment of our life, through our every mood-shifts. If you think of the way certain emotions are described, there\u2019s no denying that colour and mood are inextricably linked. Open a sunny yellow umbrella, and some of the sunniness will undoubtedly rub off on you. \u2018Hot as Red,\u2019 \u2018Easy being Green\u2019 and such several other phrases aren\u2019t very unknown to us. Besides our eyes, the power of colours can be felt through ears and touch also, that is, ultimately through the heart. You subconsciously ascribe colours to people you\u2019ve met and to the songs you listen to. Even after all this, we kind of overlook it. Maybe, all we need in our fast-paced life is a memo from colours.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc9b278 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"dc9b278\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-1eb7364 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"1eb7364\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-fc4dbb0 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"fc4dbb0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was morning on a fine Saturday, aka holiday.

two precious and indispensable orbs do other than enabling us to see? The eyes are the most underrated means of expressing one&#8217;s emotions, even though they are extensively used to convey almost all the feelings that we go through. From adults to children, everyone communicates through their eyes.<\/p><p>Over the years we have learned what different emotions the eyes express. One of the first emotions expressed by the eyes that we perceived was perhaps love. The way our mothers&#8217; looked at us, even as babies we knew what love meant and that we were dearly loved. Soon, we picked up other emotions as well. There is perhaps no other means of expressing emotions that is as effortless as the eyes. What we are feeling within ourselves is often shown by our eyes without us having to make an effort to express. The people closest to us immediately understand what&#8217;s going on with us, whether we are happy, excited, sad or any other kinds of emotions that we may be experiencing. There are a wide array of emotions that can be expressed through the eyes. When someone&#8217;s eyes lit up, we figure that they are excited and are experiencing joy. We often use expressions such as &#8216;his eyes were filled with regret&#8217; or &#8216;her eyes were smiling.&#8217; Isn&#8217;t it beautiful the way the two orbs sync with our emotions?<\/p><p>Sometimes understanding the emotions of some people through their eyes can be quite perplexing as they might be experiencing complicated feelings. Also, some people are able to deceive people by showing false emotions through their eyes and hence as you might have already heard, this type of eyes are described as the &#8216;deceiving eyes.&#8217; It&#8217;s bewildering how greatly the emotions in the eyes can affect the person perceiving them. If someone glares at us, we know that the person is angry and immediately we stop doing whatever&#8217;s making that person angry. Have you wondered what the expression &#8216;cold gaze&#8217; or &#8216;cold eyes&#8217; mean? I think it has something to do with the eyes that lack emotions or unemotional eyes. Isn&#8217;t it mind-boggling that eyes can even express &#8216;No emotions&#8217;?<\/p><p>The role that our eyes play in communicating with the people, most of the times subconsciously is essential. Imagine if our eyes were capable of showing only one emotion or no emotions at all, what would happen then? The communication of emotions would be chaotic, and it would be almost impossible for us to comprehend feelings. It&#8217;s always helpful to know the emotional state of the person whom you are communicating with, and the cherry on top is that it can be done just by observing their eyes! It&#8217;s almost like a game, predicting what a person&#8217;s eyes are saying. Look out for the eyes people!<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f46e4f6 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f46e4f6\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-510b2fd elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"510b2fd\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c9284a4 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"c9284a4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-P-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever wondered what else our two precious and indispensable orbs do other than enabling us to see?
